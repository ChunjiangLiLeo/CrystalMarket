"Just the other day, I put a pearl necklace on my orange tabby and asked him if he was a pearl boy. Within seconds he had maneuvered the necklace around his torso. I chased him around four different rooms trying to help him get it off and finally caught him when he was distracted as he was chewing and pulling on my brand new $4 estate sale REAL pearl necklace (score). That necklace was on its last life, mere moments from being snapped and pearls strewn about my living room which was also scary because he likes to grab tiny rolling objects and run away with them in his little mouth (AirPods, rings, beads) so I also saved him from choking. It was an intense 30 seconds but lessons were learned.

Cats don‚Äôt like accessories, but it would be cute if they did."
If it was in front of me right now I definitely would give $20 to have that!!! (CAD) It looks beautiful I love amethyst
You can use Google to find out like there's an üëÅ thingy look in your photos pull the picture up and look in the upper right hand corner.
Crystal shops tend to overprice a lot of the things they sell! I personally think if you really love it then it‚Äôs worth it though . But in my opinion I wouldn‚Äôt pay more than $10-$15 for that necklace. It‚Äôs pretty but it‚Äôs not a super unique kind of crystal and they are all so small.
Good idea about videos!!  Thank you!
"That‚Äôs what I tell myself when I lose things, it does take away the sting a bit!"
Most definitely unakite..
No. I could make that myself for like $2.
"It was at some type of convention or warehouse sale, there were many vendors. It was so cool!"
But be aware: They often are pricey.
Look for Zuni fetishes in Google.
Very cool! Did you dig that piece or order it? I've done both... lol. I've got some Scolcite that I would never be able to find in the USA. Found at a local trade show.
"I hope I find the jade coffin, sounds amazing!"
"Nice bunch! I carry a medicine bag, as well, and in it I carry a bear fetish in turquoise, two crystals, and a small swath of hair (my granddaughter‚Äôs)."
"Gorgeous!  I have one too!

Thanks!!
Unfortunate but you never know how much someone else might have needed a little light in their life. I actually carry them all the time & occasionally I'll give them as gifts to random strangers I think need them. I have always had people really grateful & happy to get them. Maybe someone needed it more than you today. The Universe works in strange but magical ways like that. üí´üíõüí´
Unikite
If it is hand made and with real stone it worth probably more than $25 depending on the type of stone. If it is a cheap chinese plastic crap I wll give away and I will not pay a single dollar.
Sounds like you like pretty specimens like me.
Yes i would pay 20. Ive paid 10 for amethyst bracelets
The leaf slab design is such a good idea for a moss agate omggg üò©
"I have a very yellow smokey quartz with insane clarity, so it could be smokey quartz? It's not often I see natural citrine (personally)"
Thank you! The orange/red areas are usually darker on Unakite so I wasn't 100% sure.
Where did you get it / how much did it cost? üëÄ
It sure is

I have a feeling it‚Äôs going to find its way back to you!

"I live in the US and I would pay $20 for it if it's labeled as handmade, small business, etc. I used to run a small business and I have made jewelry so I know what goes into the time of planning, purchasing, putting it all together and then the time to post it. I only closed my small business because I had to take care of a couple extra family members and I didn't have the time and energy for both.

I have used formulas to price my art and creations (materials + labor + overhead + profit = final price) or Multiply your material cost by a predetermined factor (like 2.5 or 3) to arrive at a selling price. I have a similar formula that I was using for my small business but I can't find it at the moment. I found these on Google though and they are similar to what I was doing. Here is a screenshot of what I found on Google. I hope it helps.

That color is absolutely incredible!! Thanks for sharing!
No
I have had crystals disappear off shelves while living alone. I always take it as they did their job with me and now have to find someone new to help.
Nice !
It looks well made also

"Ask the Universe to replace your lost stone with another crystal, be it the same type or different... let it know you want a crystal that is going to vibe with you and help you on your current path.

The last time I put it out there that I felt I needed some crystals I don't yet have, less than 2 weeks later, I found a deal of a lifetime for a dozen or so crystals. Many of which I have wanted for a long time. I felt drawn as hell to them, and the lady selling them was an angel, and I don't know how she parted with them for so cheap, but yeah. Paid something like less than $10 for each. When I got them in the mail, I knew for certain that the Universe had answered my call. üíú"
I had an awesome mahogany obsidian stone I lost about 2 weeks ago. I hope a new owner found it and it's energies are helping them! At least I still have my petrified wood ‚ô•
"Smoky quartz point, very cool"
Rainbow fluorite. Beautiful
Looks like Smokey quartz to me!
"Yes, the lighter color could be impurities/ inclusions in the jade. Like chalcedony or chrysotile. Looks to be from India region."
"Is it worth $20?
-depends on what the clasps and chain are made of. If they're good quality, then yes.

Why?
-Because you can easily go to Hobby Lobby or Michaels or something and get some little amethyst gems and make your own necklace for less than that. But an experienced and/or creative jewelry maker who cares about their products might put some effort into it, and you could tell by the quality they put into it. 

For example, you can find Ammonite necklaces for $20-$30 but literally I just went to Hobby Lobby and bought an ammonite pendant for $7 and some waxed cotton chord for another $5 or so and that's good enough for me,"
"This might be an unpopular opinion to me, but $20 is cheap. Paying only $10 would just cover the cost of materials if you bought the materials locally. It probably took 30-60 minutes to assemble, so you are ""valuing"" your time. What's your time worth? $10/hr? Let's not forget the fees you pay when taking payment or hosting a stand at a local market. Anyone who's ever ran a business knows the value of your product. Consumers have been spoiled by Temu and Shein. You can't get those prices in the US, that's why they buy overseas. Duh, then expect Americans to charge Chinese prices. Insane. Nope. Don't cave to their unrealistic expectations. Charge $30 or two for $50. Then matching bracelet for $5. Your time is worth something. And BTW, Chinese can feed a family for $1000/mo total monthly bills. An ENTIRE family for $1000 plus free health care. So, you can't compare rates from China versus rates from the US. You need to be able to feed your family here in the US. Don't become a slave to the system."
"You are not an idiot - you are born of the stars. And so you must always be in oneness with your lovelies from your best, highest self. That means not putting yourself down, but approaching this from the perspective that either someone else really needed this more and the spirit of the stone knew that (and one could argue in conjunction with your higher self which knew exactly the shirts to wear to make it all happen), or 2) It felt you had gotten everything you could from it and so made a gentle exit or 3) It will make its way back to you in some fashion. 

I would also light a candle and meditate on it for a bit until you have a clear picture of it in your mind and you can feel the heart connection and then send a little prayer of gratitude to it for being with you, and telling it how much you love it and hiw special it is and how you do so want to see it again. 

Stones break and they leave. And they do sometimes come back. Blessed be the Spirit of the Stone."
"$15, and that‚Äôs only if I made it by hand and was going to sell it if a craft fair"

Calcite is quite soft at a hardness of 3 and this stone has a hardness of 7
correct
it doesn‚Äôt have the lemony yellow tone of any lemon quartz that i‚Äôve seen
Men are not bright.
"Before you completely give up on your lost crystal, try seeing if anyone has turned it in at your job (most places have lost and found areas). You could also try asking coworkers if they've seen it... let them know it was very sentimental to you. Hopefully, someone will do the right thing and return it to you. In the future, if you're going to carry around loose crystals, I would only do so in a draw string pouch attached to a necklace (preferably)."
I would say rhodonite.   Looks like the color may be enhanced.

Agreed!

Rhodochrosite possibly but I doubt it lacks the white. People tend to confuse these stones. It is Rhodonite though (Seller)

Ofc!

I love labradorite and never seen this kind of flash in person. I‚Äôm happy with my purchase üåª

You're not an idiot for this happening, not at all.  It's just a lesson learned about pokey pieces in you pocket.

It's okay to be really upset. But you'll find another, new piece to cherish."

You can use Google to find out like there's an üëÅ thingy look in your photos pull the picture up and look in the upper right hand corner.
Crystal shops tend to overprice a lot of the things they sell! I personally think if you really love it then it‚Äôs worth it though . But in my opinion I wouldn‚Äôt pay more than $10-$15 for that necklace. It‚Äôs pretty but it‚Äôs not a super unique kind of crystal and they are all so small.
Good idea about videos!!  Thank you!

No. I could make that myself for like $2.

Very cool! Did you dig that piece or order it? I've done both... lol. I've got some Scolcite that I would never be able to find in the USA. Found at a local trade show.

Unfortunate but you never know how much someone else might have needed a little light in their life. I actually carry them all the time & occasionally I'll give them as gifts to random strangers I think need them. I have always had people really grateful & happy to get them.

If it is hand made and with real stone it worth probably more than $25 depending on the type of stone. If it is a cheap chinese plastic crap I wll give away and I will not pay a single dollar.

"Smoky quartz point, very cool"
Rainbow fluorite. Beautiful
Looks like Smokey quartz to me!
"Yes, the lighter color could be impurities/ inclusions in the jade. Like chalcedony or chrysotile. Looks to be from India region."
"Is it worth $20?
-depends on what the clasps and chain are made of. If they're good quality, then yes.

Why?
-Because you can easily go to Hobby Lobby or Michaels or something and get some little amethyst gems and make your own necklace for less than that. But an experienced and/or creative jewelry maker who cares about their products might put some effort into it, and you could tell by the quality they put into it. 

For example, you can find Ammonite necklaces for $20-$30 but literally I just went to Hobby Lobby and bought an ammonite pendant for $7 and some waxed cotton chord for another $5 or so and that's good enough for me,"
"This might be an unpopular opinion to me, but $20 is cheap. Paying only $10 would just cover the cost of materials if you bought the materials locally. It probably took 30-60 minutes to assemble, so you are ""valuing"" your time. What's your time worth? $10/hr? Let's not forget the fees you pay when taking payment or hosting a stand at a local market. Anyone who's ever ran a business knows the value of your product. Consumers have been spoiled by Temu and Shein. You can't get those prices in the US, that's why they buy overseas. Duh, then expect Americans to charge Chinese prices. Insane. Nope. Don't cave to their unrealistic expectations. Charge $30 or two for $50. Then matching bracelet for $5. Your time is worth something. And BTW, Chinese can feed a family for $1000/mo total monthly bills. An ENTIRE family for $1000 plus free health care. So, you can't compare rates from China versus rates from the US. You need to be able to feed your family here in the US. Don't become a slave to the system."
"You are not an idiot - you are born of the stars. And so you must always be in oneness with your lovelies from your best, highest self. That means not putting yourself down, but approaching this from the perspective that either someone else really needed this more and the spirit of the stone knew that (and one could argue in conjunction with your higher self which knew exactly the shirts to wear to make it all happen), or 2) It felt you had gotten everything you could from it and so made a gentle exit or 3) It will make its way back to you in some fashion. 

I would also light a candle and meditate on it for a bit until you have a clear picture of it in your mind and you can feel the heart connection and then send a little prayer of gratitude to it for being with you, and telling it how much you love it and hiw special it is and how you do so want to see it again. 

Stones break and they leave. And they do sometimes come back. Blessed be the Spirit of the Stone."

"Before you completely give up on your lost crystal, try seeing if anyone has turned it in at your job (most places have lost and found areas). You could also try asking coworkers if they've seen it... let them know it was very sentimental to you. Hopefully, someone will do the right thing and return it to you. In the future, if you're going to carry around loose crystals, I would only do so in a draw string pouch attached to a necklace (preferably)."

Very cool! Did you dig that piece or order it? I've done both... lol. I've got some Scolcite that I would never be able to find in the USA. Found at a local trade show.

Unfortunate but you never know how much someone else might have needed a little light in their life. I actually carry them all the time & occasionally I'll give them as gifts to random strangers I think need them. I have always had people really grateful & happy to get them.

If it is hand made and with real stone it worth probably more than $25 depending on the type of stone. If it is a cheap chinese plastic crap I wll give away and I will not pay a single dollar.

Nice !
It looks well made also

"Smoky quartz point, very cool"
Rainbow fluorite. Beautiful
Looks like Smokey quartz to me!
"Yes, the lighter color could be impurities/ inclusions in the jade. Like chalcedony or chrysotile. Looks to be from India region."
"Is it worth $20?
-depends on what the clasps and chain are made of. If they're good quality, then yes.

Why?
-Because you can easily go to Hobby Lobby or Michaels or something and get some little amethyst gems and make your own necklace for less than that. But an experienced and/or creative jewelry maker who cares about their products might put some effort into it, and you could tell by the quality they put into it. 

For example, you can find Ammonite necklaces for $20-$30 but literally I just went to Hobby Lobby and bought an ammonite pendant for $7 and some waxed cotton chord for another $5 or so and that's good enough for me,"
"This might be an unpopular opinion to me, but $20 is cheap. Paying only $10 would just cover the cost of materials if you bought the materials locally. It probably took 30-60 minutes to assemble, so you are ""valuing"" your time. What's your time worth? $10/hr? Let's not forget the fees you pay when taking payment or hosting a stand at a local market. Anyone who's ever ran a business knows the value of your product. Consumers have been spoiled by Temu and Shein. You can't get those prices in the US, that's why they buy overseas. Duh, then expect Americans to charge Chinese prices. Insane. Nope. Don't cave to their unrealistic expectations. Charge $30 or two for $50. Then matching bracelet for $5. Your time is worth something. And BTW, Chinese can feed a family for $1000/mo total monthly bills. An ENTIRE family for $1000 plus free health care. So, you can't compare rates from China versus rates from the US. You need to be able to feed your family here in the US. Don't become a slave to the system."
"You are not an idiot - you are born of the stars. And so you must always be in oneness with your lovelies from your best, highest self. That means not putting yourself down, but approaching this from the perspective that either someone else really needed this more and the spirit of the stone knew that (and one could argue in conjunction with your higher self which knew exactly the shirts to wear to make it all happen), or 2) It felt you had gotten everything you could from it and so made a gentle exit or 3) It will make its way back to you in some fashion. 

I would also light a candle and meditate on it for a bit until you have a clear picture of it in your mind and you can feel the heart connection and then send a little prayer of gratitude to it for being with you, and telling it how much you love it and hiw special it is and how you do so want to see it again. 

Stones break and they leave. And they do sometimes come back. Blessed be the Spirit of the Stone."

correct
it doesn‚Äôt have the lemony yellow tone of any lemon quartz that i‚Äôve seen
Men are not bright.
"Before you completely give up on your lost crystal, try seeing if anyone has turned it in at your job (most places have lost and found areas). You could also try asking coworkers if they've seen it... let them know it was very sentimental to you. Hopefully, someone will do the right thing and return it to you. In the future, if you're going to carry around loose crystals, I would only do so in a draw string pouch attached to a necklace (preferably)."
I would say rhodonite.   Looks like the color may be enhanced.

You're not an idiot for this happening, not at all.  It's just a lesson learned about pokey pieces in you pocket.

It's okay to be really upset. But you'll find another, new piece to cherish."

That necklace was on its last life, mere moments from being snapped and pearls strewn about my living room which was also scary because he likes to grab tiny rolling objects and run away with them in his little mouth (AirPods, rings, beads) so I also saved him from choking. It was an intense 30 seconds but lessons were learned.

Crystal shops tend to overprice a lot of the things they sell! I personally think if you really love it then it‚Äôs worth it though . But in my opinion I wouldn‚Äôt pay more than $10-$15 for that necklace. It‚Äôs pretty but it‚Äôs not a super unique kind of crystal and they are all so small.

I only closed my small business because I had to take care of a couple extra family members and I didn't have the time and energy for both.

I have used formulas to price my art and creations (materials + labor + overhead + profit = final price) or Multiply your material cost by a predetermined factor (like 2.5 or 3) to arrive at a selling price.

No
I have had crystals disappear off shelves while living alone. I always take it as they did their job with me and now have to find someone new to help.
Nice !
It looks well made also

"Ask the Universe to replace your lost stone with another crystal, be it the same type or different... let it know you want a crystal that is going to vibe with you and help you on your current path.

I had an awesome mahogany obsidian stone I lost about 2 weeks ago. I hope a new owner found it and it's energies are helping them! At least I still have my petrified wood ‚ô•
"Smoky quartz point, very cool"
Rainbow fluorite. Beautiful
Looks like Smokey quartz to me!
"Yes, the lighter color could be impurities/ inclusions in the jade. Like chalcedony or chrysotile. Looks to be from India region."
"Is it worth $20?
-depends on what the clasps and chain are made of. If they're good quality, then yes.

Why?
-Because you can easily go to Hobby Lobby or Michaels or something and get some little amethyst gems and make your own necklace for less than that. But an experienced and/or creative jewelry maker who cares about their products might put some effort into it, and you could tell by the quality they put into it. 

For example, you can find Ammonite necklaces for $20-$30 but literally I just went to Hobby Lobby and bought an ammonite pendant for $7 and some waxed cotton chord for another $5 or so and that's good enough for me,"
"This might be an unpopular opinion to me, but $20 is cheap. Paying only $10 would just cover the cost of materials if you bought the materials locally. It probably took 30-60 minutes to assemble, so you are ""valuing"" your time. What's your time worth? $10/hr? Let's not forget the fees you pay when taking payment or hosting a stand at a local market. Anyone who's ever ran a business knows the value of your product. Consumers have been spoiled by Temu and Shein. You can't get those prices in the US, that's why they buy overseas. Duh, then expect Americans to charge Chinese prices. Insane. Nope. Don't cave to their unrealistic expectations. Charge $30 or two for $50. Then matching bracelet for $5. Your time is worth something. And BTW, Chinese can feed a family for $1000/mo total monthly bills. An ENTIRE family for $1000 plus free health care. So, you can't compare rates from China versus rates from the US. You need to be able to feed your family here in the US. Don't become a slave to the system."
"You are not an idiot - you are born of the stars. And so you must always be in oneness with your lovelies from your best, highest self. That means not putting yourself down, but approaching this from the perspective that either someone else really needed this more and the spirit of the stone knew that (and one could argue in conjunction with your higher self which knew exactly the shirts to wear to make it all happen), or 2) It felt you had gotten everything you could from it and so made a gentle exit or 3) It will make its way back to you in some fashion. 

I would also light a candle and meditate on it for a bit until you have a clear picture of it in your mind and you can feel the heart connection and then send a little prayer of gratitude to it for being with you, and telling it how much you love it and hiw special it is and how you do so want to see it again. 

Stones break and they leave. And they do sometimes come back. Blessed be the Spirit of the Stone."
"$15, and that‚Äôs only if I made it by hand and was going to sell it if a craft fair"

Calcite is quite soft at a hardness of 3 and this stone has a hardness of 7
correct
it doesn‚Äôt have the lemony yellow tone of any lemon quartz that i‚Äôve seen
Men are not bright.
"Before you completely give up on your lost crystal, try seeing if anyone has turned it in at your job (most places have lost and found areas). You could also try asking coworkers if they've seen it... let them know it was very sentimental to you. Hopefully, someone will do the right thing and return it to you. In the future, if you're going to carry around loose crystals, I would only do so in a draw string pouch attached to a necklace (preferably)."
I would say rhodonite.   Looks like the color may be enhanced.

Rhodochrosite possibly but I doubt it lacks the white. People tend to confuse these stones. It is Rhodonite though (Seller)

"A couple weeks ago I started sleeping with raw Celestite next to my pillow on my side table. I have been sleeping so good and dreaming vividly.

"My friend made me a gem and wire pendant and like to carry it with me instead of wearing it I found a small drawstring bag amongst my things from a crystal purchase and now i carry the pendant around w a couple of other tiny stones. 

So I still go to check all day to, make sure it's still in my pocket, but it's working for now- one time I lost the pendanit for a few days in the house and boy, i was devastated. 

You're not an idiot for this happening, not at all.  It's just a lesson learned about pokey pieces in you pocket.

It's okay to be really upset. But you'll find another, new piece to cherish."

I chased him around four different rooms trying to help him get it off and finally caught him when he was distracted as he was chewing and pulling on my brand new $4 estate sale REAL pearl necklace (score). That necklace was on its last life, mere moments from being snapped and pearls strewn about my living room which was also scary because he likes to grab tiny rolling objects and run away with them in his little mouth (AirPods, rings, beads) so I also saved him from choking. It was an intense 30 seconds but lessons were learned.

Cats don‚Äôt like accessories, but it would be cute if they did."
If it was in front of me right now I definitely would give $20 to have that!!! (CAD) It looks beautiful I love amethyst
You can use Google to find out like there's an üëÅ thingy look in your photos pull the picture up and look in the upper right hand corner.
Crystal shops tend to overprice a lot of the things they sell! I personally think if you really love it then it‚Äôs worth it though . But in my opinion I wouldn‚Äôt pay more than $10-$15 for that necklace. It‚Äôs pretty but it‚Äôs not a super unique kind of crystal and they are all so small.
Good idea about videos!!  Thank you!
"That‚Äôs what I tell myself when I lose things, it does take away the sting a bit!"

No. I could make that myself for like $2.

That color is absolutely incredible!! Thanks for sharing!
No
I have had crystals disappear off shelves while living alone. I always take it as they did their job with me and now have to find someone new to help.
Nice !
It looks well made also
"Seems about right , 20 dollars is nothing anymore."
"Alternately, bring them with you but ensure they are being carried safely so that they won't get lost! üòÖ

"Ask the Universe to replace your lost stone with another crystal, be it the same type or different... let it know you want a crystal that is going to vibe with you and help you on your current path.

The last time I put it out there that I felt I needed some crystals I don't yet have, less than 2 weeks later, I found a deal of a lifetime for a dozen or so crystals. Many of which I have wanted for a long time. I felt drawn as hell to them, and the lady selling them was an angel, and I don't know how she parted with them for so cheap, but yeah. Paid something like less than $10 for each. When I got them in the mail, I knew for certain that the Universe had answered my call. üíú"
I had an awesome mahogany obsidian stone I lost about 2 weeks ago. I hope a new owner found it and it's energies are helping them! At least I still have my petrified wood ‚ô•
"Smoky quartz point, very cool"
Rainbow fluorite. Beautiful
Looks like Smokey quartz to me!
"Yes, the lighter color could be impurities/ inclusions in the jade. Like chalcedony or chrysotile. Looks to be from India region."
"Is it worth $20?
-depends on what the clasps and chain are made of. If they're good quality, then yes.

Why?
-Because you can easily go to Hobby Lobby or Michaels or something and get some little amethyst gems and make your own necklace for less than that. But an experienced and/or creative jewelry maker who cares about their products might put some effort into it, and you could tell by the quality they put into it. 

For example, you can find Ammonite necklaces for $20-$30 but literally I just went to Hobby Lobby and bought an ammonite pendant for $7 and some waxed cotton chord for another $5 or so and that's good enough for me,"
"This might be an unpopular opinion to me, but $20 is cheap. Paying only $10 would just cover the cost of materials if you bought the materials locally. It probably took 30-60 minutes to assemble, so you are ""valuing"" your time. What's your time worth? $10/hr? Let's not forget the fees you pay when taking payment or hosting a stand at a local market. Anyone who's ever ran a business knows the value of your product. Consumers have been spoiled by Temu and Shein. You can't get those prices in the US, that's why they buy overseas. Duh, then expect Americans to charge Chinese prices. Insane. Nope. Don't cave to their unrealistic expectations. Charge $30 or two for $50. Then matching bracelet for $5. Your time is worth something. And BTW, Chinese can feed a family for $1000/mo total monthly bills. An ENTIRE family for $1000 plus free health care. So, you can't compare rates from China versus rates from the US. You need to be able to feed your family here in the US. Don't become a slave to the system."
"You are not an idiot - you are born of the stars. And so you must always be in oneness with your lovelies from your best, highest self. That means not putting yourself down, but approaching this from the perspective that either someone else really needed this more and the spirit of the stone knew that (and one could argue in conjunction with your higher self which knew exactly the shirts to wear to make it all happen), or 2) It felt you had gotten everything you could from it and so made a gentle exit or 3) It will make its way back to you in some fashion. 

I would also light a candle and meditate on it for a bit until you have a clear picture of it in your mind and you can feel the heart connection and then send a little prayer of gratitude to it for being with you, and telling it how much you love it and hiw special it is and how you do so want to see it again. 

Stones break and they leave. And they do sometimes come back. Blessed be the Spirit of the Stone."
"$15, and that‚Äôs only if I made it by hand and was going to sell it if a craft fair"
‚ÄúThanks. Smuggled it out of Africa in my arse‚Äù
Looks like a cookies and cream treat
Calcite is quite soft at a hardness of 3 and this stone has a hardness of 7
correct
it doesn‚Äôt have the lemony yellow tone of any lemon quartz that i‚Äôve seen
Men are not bright.
"Before you completely give up on your lost crystal, try seeing if anyone has turned it in at your job (most places have lost and found areas). You could also try asking coworkers if they've seen it... let them know it was very sentimental to you. Hopefully, someone will do the right thing and return it to you. In the future, if you're going to carry around loose crystals, I would only do so in a draw string pouch attached to a necklace (preferably)."
I would say rhodonite.   Looks like the color may be enhanced.
"Lab, Amazonite, Carnelian and can‚Äôt make out the other 3‚Ä¶. Need better pictures"
Fluorite
Agreed!
"Little steep at $20, but if it sings to you..."

Druzy Agate!
Looks like Sodalite (seller here)
Aura Quartz
Rhodochrosite possibly but I doubt it lacks the white. People tend to confuse these stones. It is Rhodonite though (Seller)

No way

all rhodonite has pink in it! But yes its rhodonite
Ofc!

I love labradorite and never seen this kind of flash in person. I‚Äôm happy with my purchase üåª
I'm gonna go with lemon quartz.

"I have a cool phantom lab grown quartz like this! They are cool looking for sure. Definitely lab grown, but perfect pieces for planters in my house!"
"No, but that's only because I make necklaces and could do this myself. No disrespect at all, but this is simple stringing beadwork. Also, I am always very aware of things touching my skin, and these irregular chip beads distract me."
"A couple weeks ago I started sleeping with raw Celestite next to my pillow on my side table. I have been sleeping so good and dreaming vividly. I didn‚Äôt know this about Celestite before getting my  piece, but it‚Äôs supposed to be one of the best crystals for sleep. I can attest it has been highly noticeable since I got mine. Gorgeous piece you have!"
"I'm sorry for your loss.   Be careful.  There may be fiberglass or sharp crystals.

Edit:  It looks like glued crystals (possibly lab grown) with spiky, sharp lab grown crystals covering the glued areas.   Here's one without the extra added crystals.

"My first amethyst, i found a chipped heart in a parking lot. I love it so much, and I give thanks to the person who lost it, whoever they may be."
"My friend made me a gem and wire pendant and like to carry it with me instead of wearing it I found a small drawstring bag amongst my things from a crystal purchase and now i carry the pendant around w a couple of other tiny stones. 

So I still go to check all day to, make sure it's still in my pocket, but it's working for now- one time I lost the pendanit for a few days in the house and boy, i was devastated. 

You're not an idiot for this happening, not at all.  It's just a lesson learned about pokey pieces in you pocket.

It's okay to be really upset. But you'll find another, new piece to cherish."
Calcite???
that‚Äôs a happy accident! someone else can enjoy it now
That‚Äôs a hard no for me.

"Just the other day, I put a pearl necklace on my orange tabby and asked him if he was a pearl boy. Within seconds he had maneuvered the necklace around his torso. I chased him around four different rooms trying to help him get it off and finally caught him when he was distracted as he was chewing and pulling on my brand new $4 estate sale REAL pearl necklace (score). That necklace was on its last life, mere moments from being snapped and pearls strewn about my living room which was also scary because he likes to grab tiny rolling objects and run away with them in his little mouth (AirPods, rings, beads) so I also saved him from choking. It was an intense 30 seconds but lessons were learned.

Cats don‚Äôt like accessories, but it would be cute if they did."
If it was in front of me right now I definitely would give $20 to have that!!! (CAD) It looks beautiful I love amethyst
You can use Google to find out like there's an üëÅ thingy look in your photos pull the picture up and look in the upper right hand corner.
Crystal shops tend to overprice a lot of the things they sell! I personally think if you really love it then it‚Äôs worth it though . But in my opinion I wouldn‚Äôt pay more than $10-$15 for that necklace. It‚Äôs pretty but it‚Äôs not a super unique kind of crystal and they are all so small.
Good idea about videos!!  Thank you!
"That‚Äôs what I tell myself when I lose things, it does take away the sting a bit!"
Most definitely unakite..
No. I could make that myself for like $2.
"It was at some type of convention or warehouse sale, there were many vendors. It was so cool!"
But be aware: They often are pricey.
Look for Zuni fetishes in Google.
Very cool! Did you dig that piece or order it? I've done both... lol. I've got some Scolcite that I would never be able to find in the USA. Found at a local trade show.

Unfortunate but you never know how much someone else might have needed a little light in their life. I actually carry them all the time & occasionally I'll give them as gifts to random strangers I think need them. I have always had people really grateful & happy to get them.

Unikite
If it is hand made and with real stone it worth probably more than $25 depending on the type of stone. If it is a cheap chinese plastic crap I wll give away and I will not pay a single dollar.

Yes i would pay 20. Ive paid 10 for amethyst bracelets

That color is absolutely incredible!! Thanks for sharing!
No
I have had crystals disappear off shelves while living alone. I always take it as they did their job with me and now have to find someone new to help.
Nice !
It looks well made also
"Seems about right , 20 dollars is nothing anymore."
"Alternately, bring them with you but ensure they are being carried safely so that they won't get lost! üòÖ

Smoky quartz
"Ask the Universe to replace your lost stone with another crystal, be it the same type or different... let it know you want a crystal that is going to vibe with you and help you on your current path.

The last time I put it out there that I felt I needed some crystals I don't yet have, less than 2 weeks later, I found a deal of a lifetime for a dozen or so crystals. Many of which I have wanted for a long time. I felt drawn as hell to them, and the lady selling them was an angel, and I don't know how she parted with them for so cheap, but yeah. Paid something like less than $10 for each. When I got them in the mail, I knew for certain that the Universe had answered my call. üíú"
I had an awesome mahogany obsidian stone I lost about 2 weeks ago. I hope a new owner found it and it's energies are helping them! At least I still have my petrified wood ‚ô•
"Smoky quartz point, very cool"
Rainbow fluorite. Beautiful
Looks like Smokey quartz to me!
"Yes, the lighter color could be impurities/ inclusions in the jade. Like chalcedony or chrysotile. Looks to be from India region."
"Is it worth $20?
-depends on what the clasps and chain are made of. If they're good quality, then yes.

Why?
-Because you can easily go to Hobby Lobby or Michaels or something and get some little amethyst gems and make your own necklace for less than that. But an experienced and/or creative jewelry maker who cares about their products might put some effort into it, and you could tell by the quality they put into it. 

For example, you can find Ammonite necklaces for $20-$30 but literally I just went to Hobby Lobby and bought an ammonite pendant for $7 and some waxed cotton chord for another $5 or so and that's good enough for me,"
"This might be an unpopular opinion to me, but $20 is cheap. Paying only $10 would just cover the cost of materials if you bought the materials locally. It probably took 30-60 minutes to assemble, so you are ""valuing"" your time. What's your time worth? $10/hr? Let's not forget the fees you pay when taking payment or hosting a stand at a local market. Anyone who's ever ran a business knows the value of your product. Consumers have been spoiled by Temu and Shein. You can't get those prices in the US, that's why they buy overseas. Duh, then expect Americans to charge Chinese prices. Insane. Nope. Don't cave to their unrealistic expectations. Charge $30 or two for $50. Then matching bracelet for $5. Your time is worth something. And BTW, Chinese can feed a family for $1000/mo total monthly bills. An ENTIRE family for $1000 plus free health care. So, you can't compare rates from China versus rates from the US. You need to be able to feed your family here in the US. Don't become a slave to the system."
"You are not an idiot - you are born of the stars. And so you must always be in oneness with your lovelies from your best, highest self. That means not putting yourself down, but approaching this from the perspective that either someone else really needed this more and the spirit of the stone knew that (and one could argue in conjunction with your higher self which knew exactly the shirts to wear to make it all happen), or 2) It felt you had gotten everything you could from it and so made a gentle exit or 3) It will make its way back to you in some fashion. 

I would also light a candle and meditate on it for a bit until you have a clear picture of it in your mind and you can feel the heart connection and then send a little prayer of gratitude to it for being with you, and telling it how much you love it and hiw special it is and how you do so want to see it again. 

Stones break and they leave. And they do sometimes come back. Blessed be the Spirit of the Stone."
"$15, and that‚Äôs only if I made it by hand and was going to sell it if a craft fair"
‚ÄúThanks. Smuggled it out of Africa in my arse‚Äù
Looks like a cookies and cream treat
Calcite is quite soft at a hardness of 3 and this stone has a hardness of 7
correct
it doesn‚Äôt have the lemony yellow tone of any lemon quartz that i‚Äôve seen
Men are not bright.
"Before you completely give up on your lost crystal, try seeing if anyone has turned it in at your job (most places have lost and found areas). You could also try asking coworkers if they've seen it... let them know it was very sentimental to you. Hopefully, someone will do the right thing and return it to you. In the future, if you're going to carry around loose crystals, I would only do so in a draw string pouch attached to a necklace (preferably)."
I would say rhodonite.   Looks like the color may be enhanced.
"Lab, Amazonite, Carnelian and can‚Äôt make out the other 3‚Ä¶. Need better pictures"
Fluorite
Agreed!
"Little steep at $20, but if it sings to you..."

Druzy Agate!
Looks like Sodalite (seller here)
Aura Quartz
Rhodochrosite possibly but I doubt it lacks the white. People tend to confuse these stones. It is Rhodonite though (Seller)
"Is it actually a loop at the bottom? I thought it was just the necklace touching the sides together. But now I look at it, it does look like a loop‚Ä¶"
No way

I was really thinking there was something phallic about it
all rhodonite has pink in it! But yes its rhodonite
Ofc!
Ofc
I love labradorite and never seen this kind of flash in person. I‚Äôm happy with my purchase üåª
I'm gonna go with lemon quartz.
Agate bookends....lovely find!  I found my favorite amethyst at HomeGoods ;)
WOW!! If carnelian and ocean jasper snuck off and had a love rock‚Ä¶.

"I have a cool phantom lab grown quartz like this! They are cool looking for sure. Definitely lab grown, but perfect pieces for planters in my house!"
"No, but that's only because I make necklaces and could do this myself. No disrespect at all, but this is simple stringing beadwork. Also, I am always very aware of things touching my skin, and these irregular chip beads distract me."
"A couple weeks ago I started sleeping with raw Celestite next to my pillow on my side table. I have been sleeping so good and dreaming vividly. I didn‚Äôt know this about Celestite before getting my  piece, but it‚Äôs supposed to be one of the best crystals for sleep. I can attest it has been highly noticeable since I got mine. Gorgeous piece you have!"
"I'm sorry for your loss.   Be careful.  There may be fiberglass or sharp crystals.

Edit:  It looks like glued crystals (possibly lab grown) with spiky, sharp lab grown crystals covering the glued areas.   Here's one without the extra added crystals.

"I‚Äôm in the US Midwest in a college town. For a necklace that length, at a local shop, it would go for $30. So I‚Äôd gladly pay $20."
Ohhh that is perfect!
"My first amethyst, i found a chipped heart in a parking lot. I love it so much, and I give thanks to the person who lost it, whoever they may be."
"My friend made me a gem and wire pendant and like to carry it with me instead of wearing it I found a small drawstring bag amongst my things from a crystal purchase and now i carry the pendant around w a couple of other tiny stones. 

So I still go to check all day to, make sure it's still in my pocket, but it's working for now- one time I lost the pendanit for a few days in the house and boy, i was devastated. 

You're not an idiot for this happening, not at all.  It's just a lesson learned about pokey pieces in you pocket.

It's okay to be really upset. But you'll find another, new piece to cherish."
Calcite???
that‚Äôs a happy accident! someone else can enjoy it now
That‚Äôs a hard no for me.
I read up on it and the article said only some fluorite reacts :0 but definitely want to try!

"Just the other day, I put a pearl necklace on my orange tabby and asked him if he was a pearl boy. Within seconds he had maneuvered the necklace around his torso. I chased him around four different rooms trying to help him get it off and finally caught him when he was distracted as he was chewing and pulling on my brand new $4 estate sale REAL pearl necklace (score). That necklace was on its last life, mere moments from being snapped and pearls strewn about my living room which was also scary because he likes to grab tiny rolling objects and run away with them in his little mouth (AirPods, rings, beads) so I also saved him from choking. It was an intense 30 seconds but lessons were learned.

Cats don‚Äôt like accessories, but it would be cute if they did."
If it was in front of me right now I definitely would give $20 to have that!!! (CAD) It looks beautiful I love amethyst
You can use Google to find out like there's an üëÅ thingy look in your photos pull the picture up and look in the upper right hand corner.
Crystal shops tend to overprice a lot of the things they sell! I personally think if you really love it then it‚Äôs worth it though . But in my opinion I wouldn‚Äôt pay more than $10-$15 for that necklace. It‚Äôs pretty but it‚Äôs not a super unique kind of crystal and they are all so small.
Good idea about videos!!  Thank you!
"That‚Äôs what I tell myself when I lose things, it does take away the sting a bit!"
Most definitely unakite..
No. I could make that myself for like $2.
"It was at some type of convention or warehouse sale, there were many vendors. It was so cool!"
But be aware: They often are pricey.
Look for Zuni fetishes in Google.
Very cool! Did you dig that piece or order it? I've done both... lol. I've got some Scolcite that I would never be able to find in the USA. Found at a local trade show.

Unfortunate but you never know how much someone else might have needed a little light in their life. I actually carry them all the time & occasionally I'll give them as gifts to random strangers I think need them. I have always had people really grateful & happy to get them. Maybe someone needed it more than you today. The Universe works in strange but magical ways like that. üí´üíõüí´

If it is hand made and with real stone it worth probably more than $25 depending on the type of stone. If it is a cheap chinese plastic crap I wll give away and I will not pay a single dollar.

That color is absolutely incredible!! Thanks for sharing!
No
I have had crystals disappear off shelves while living alone. I always take it as they did their job with me and now have to find someone new to help.
Nice !
It looks well made also
"Seems about right , 20 dollars is nothing anymore."
"Alternately, bring them with you but ensure they are being carried safely so that they won't get lost! üòÖ

I usually keep mine inside a little pouch, and then inside my bag or pocket. Seems to work out well! Haven't lost anyone yet ü•∞ü§™"
Smoky quartz
"Ask the Universe to replace your lost stone with another crystal, be it the same type or different... let it know you want a crystal that is going to vibe with you and help you on your current path.

The last time I put it out there that I felt I needed some crystals I don't yet have, less than 2 weeks later, I found a deal of a lifetime for a dozen or so crystals. Many of which I have wanted for a long time. I felt drawn as hell to them, and the lady selling them was an angel, and I don't know how she parted with them for so cheap, but yeah. Paid something like less than $10 for each. When I got them in the mail, I knew for certain that the Universe had answered my call. üíú"
I had an awesome mahogany obsidian stone I lost about 2 weeks ago. I hope a new owner found it and it's energies are helping them! At least I still have my petrified wood ‚ô•
"Smoky quartz point, very cool"
Rainbow fluorite. Beautiful
Looks like Smokey quartz to me!
"Yes, the lighter color could be impurities/ inclusions in the jade. Like chalcedony or chrysotile. Looks to be from India region."
"Is it worth $20?
-depends on what the clasps and chain are made of. If they're good quality, then yes.

Why?
-Because you can easily go to Hobby Lobby or Michaels or something and get some little amethyst gems and make your own necklace for less than that. But an experienced and/or creative jewelry maker who cares about their products might put some effort into it, and you could tell by the quality they put into it. 

For example, you can find Ammonite necklaces for $20-$30 but literally I just went to Hobby Lobby and bought an ammonite pendant for $7 and some waxed cotton chord for another $5 or so and that's good enough for me,"
"This might be an unpopular opinion to me, but $20 is cheap. Paying only $10 would just cover the cost of materials if you bought the materials locally. It probably took 30-60 minutes to assemble, so you are ""valuing"" your time. What's your time worth? $10/hr? Let's not forget the fees you pay when taking payment or hosting a stand at a local market. Anyone who's ever ran a business knows the value of your product. Consumers have been spoiled by Temu and Shein. You can't get those prices in the US, that's why they buy overseas. Duh, then expect Americans to charge Chinese prices. Insane. Nope. Don't cave to their unrealistic expectations. Charge $30 or two for $50. Then matching bracelet for $5. Your time is worth something. And BTW, Chinese can feed a family for $1000/mo total monthly bills. An ENTIRE family for $1000 plus free health care. So, you can't compare rates from China versus rates from the US. You need to be able to feed your family here in the US. Don't become a slave to the system."
"You are not an idiot - you are born of the stars. And so you must always be in oneness with your lovelies from your best, highest self. That means not putting yourself down, but approaching this from the perspective that either someone else really needed this more and the spirit of the stone knew that (and one could argue in conjunction with your higher self which knew exactly the shirts to wear to make it all happen), or 2) It felt you had gotten everything you could from it and so made a gentle exit or 3) It will make its way back to you in some fashion. 

I would also light a candle and meditate on it for a bit until you have a clear picture of it in your mind and you can feel the heart connection and then send a little prayer of gratitude to it for being with you, and telling it how much you love it and hiw special it is and how you do so want to see it again. 

Stones break and they leave. And they do sometimes come back. Blessed be the Spirit of the Stone."
"$15, and that‚Äôs only if I made it by hand and was going to sell it if a craft fair"
‚ÄúThanks. Smuggled it out of Africa in my arse‚Äù
Looks like a cookies and cream treat
Calcite is quite soft at a hardness of 3 and this stone has a hardness of 7
correct
it doesn‚Äôt have the lemony yellow tone of any lemon quartz that i‚Äôve seen
Men are not bright.
"Before you completely give up on your lost crystal, try seeing if anyone has turned it in at your job (most places have lost and found areas). You could also try asking coworkers if they've seen it... let them know it was very sentimental to you. Hopefully, someone will do the right thing and return it to you. In the future, if you're going to carry around loose crystals, I would only do so in a draw string pouch attached to a necklace (preferably)."
I would say rhodonite.   Looks like the color may be enhanced.
"Lab, Amazonite, Carnelian and can‚Äôt make out the other 3‚Ä¶. Need better pictures"
Fluorite
Agreed!
"Little steep at $20, but if it sings to you..."
Looks like Lower Grade Rhodochrosite
Druzy Agate!
Looks like Sodalite (seller here)
Aura Quartz
Rhodochrosite possibly but I doubt it lacks the white. People tend to confuse these stones. It is Rhodonite though (Seller)
"Is it actually a loop at the bottom? I thought it was just the necklace touching the sides together. But now I look at it, it does look like a loop‚Ä¶"
No way
"If it was sold by a local shop that ethically sources their crystals, definitely."
I‚Äôm leaning towards smoky quartz
I was really thinking there was something phallic about it
all rhodonite has pink in it! But yes its rhodonite
Ofc!
Ofc
I love labradorite and never seen this kind of flash in person. I‚Äôm happy with my purchase üåª
I'm gonna go with lemon quartz.
Agate bookends....lovely find!  I found my favorite amethyst at HomeGoods ;)
WOW!! If carnelian and ocean jasper snuck off and had a love rock‚Ä¶.
"Village Silversmith rocks account sells lab palms like these between $4 and $8. Smaller, reputable sellers will run $10-12."
15$
"I have a cool phantom lab grown quartz like this! They are cool looking for sure. Definitely lab grown, but perfect pieces for planters in my house!"
"No, but that's only because I make necklaces and could do this myself. No disrespect at all, but this is simple stringing beadwork. Also, I am always very aware of things touching my skin, and these irregular chip beads distract me."
"A couple weeks ago I started sleeping with raw Celestite next to my pillow on my side table. I have been sleeping so good and dreaming vividly. I didn‚Äôt know this about Celestite before getting my  piece, but it‚Äôs supposed to be one of the best crystals for sleep. I can attest it has been highly noticeable since I got mine. Gorgeous piece you have!"
"I'm sorry for your loss.   Be careful.  There may be fiberglass or sharp crystals.

Edit:  It looks like glued crystals (possibly lab grown) with spiky, sharp lab grown crystals covering the glued areas.   Here's one without the extra added crystals.

This is the cutest!
"I‚Äôm in the US Midwest in a college town. For a necklace that length, at a local shop, it would go for $30. So I‚Äôd gladly pay $20."
Ohhh that is perfect!
"My first amethyst, i found a chipped heart in a parking lot. I love it so much, and I give thanks to the person who lost it, whoever they may be."
"My friend made me a gem and wire pendant and like to carry it with me instead of wearing it I found a small drawstring bag amongst my things from a crystal purchase and now i carry the pendant around w a couple of other tiny stones. 

So I still go to check all day to, make sure it's still in my pocket, but it's working for now- one time I lost the pendanit for a few days in the house and boy, i was devastated. 

You're not an idiot for this happening, not at all.  It's just a lesson learned about pokey pieces in you pocket.

It's okay to be really upset. But you'll find another, new piece to cherish."
Calcite???
that‚Äôs a happy accident! someone else can enjoy it now
That‚Äôs a hard no for me.
I read up on it and the article said only some fluorite reacts :0 but definitely want to try!
"That's so funny, never occurred to me that people might make such a mistake üòÖ

‚ÄúMy hemorrhoids sparkled for weeks‚Äù
"Just the other day, I put a pearl necklace on my orange tabby and asked him if he was a pearl boy. Within seconds he had maneuvered the necklace around his torso. I chased him around four different rooms trying to help him get it off and finally caught him when he was distracted as he was chewing and pulling on my brand new $4 estate sale REAL pearl necklace (score). That necklace was on its last life, mere moments from being snapped and pearls strewn about my living room which was also scary because he likes to grab tiny rolling objects and run away with them in his little mouth (AirPods, rings, beads) so I also saved him from choking. It was an intense 30 seconds but lessons were learned.

Cats don‚Äôt like accessories, but it would be cute if they did."
If it was in front of me right now I definitely would give $20 to have that!!! (CAD) It looks beautiful I love amethyst
You can use Google to find out like there's an üëÅ thingy look in your photos pull the picture up and look in the upper right hand corner.
Crystal shops tend to overprice a lot of the things they sell! I personally think if you really love it then it‚Äôs worth it though . But in my opinion I wouldn‚Äôt pay more than $10-$15 for that necklace. It‚Äôs pretty but it‚Äôs not a super unique kind of crystal and they are all so small.
Good idea about videos!!  Thank you!
"That‚Äôs what I tell myself when I lose things, it does take away the sting a bit!"
Most definitely unakite..
No. I could make that myself for like $2.
"It was at some type of convention or warehouse sale, there were many vendors. It was so cool!"
But be aware: They often are pricey.
Look for Zuni fetishes in Google.
Very cool! Did you dig that piece or order it? I've done both... lol. I've got some Scolcite that I would never be able to find in the USA. Found at a local trade show.
"I hope I find the jade coffin, sounds amazing!"
"Nice bunch! I carry a medicine bag, as well, and in it I carry a bear fetish in turquoise, two crystals, and a small swath of hair (my granddaughter‚Äôs)."
"Gorgeous!  I have one too!

Thanks!!
Unfortunate but you never know how much someone else might have needed a little light in their life. I actually carry them all the time & occasionally I'll give them as gifts to random strangers I think need them. I have always had people really grateful & happy to get them. Maybe someone needed it more than you today. The Universe works in strange but magical ways like that. üí´üíõüí´
Unikite
If it is hand made and with real stone it worth probably more than $25 depending on the type of stone. If it is a cheap chinese plastic crap I wll give away and I will not pay a single dollar.
Sounds like you like pretty specimens like me.
Yes i would pay 20. Ive paid 10 for amethyst bracelets
The leaf slab design is such a good idea for a moss agate omggg üò©
"I have a very yellow smokey quartz with insane clarity, so it could be smokey quartz? It's not often I see natural citrine (personally)"

Where did you get it / how much did it cost? üëÄ
It sure is
Are all of these lab grown?
I have a feeling it‚Äôs going to find its way back to you!

I have had crystals disappear off shelves while living alone. I always take it as they did their job with me and now have to find someone new to help.
Nice !
It looks well made also
"Seems about right , 20 dollars is nothing anymore."
"Alternately, bring them with you but ensure they are being carried safely so that they won't get lost! üòÖ

Smoky quartz
"Ask the Universe to replace your lost stone with another crystal, be it the same type or different... let it know you want a crystal that is going to vibe with you and help you on your current path.

The last time I put it out there that I felt I needed some crystals I don't yet have, less than 2 weeks later, I found a deal of a lifetime for a dozen or so crystals. Many of which I have wanted for a long time. I felt drawn as hell to them, and the lady selling them was an angel, and I don't know how she parted with them for so cheap, but yeah. Paid something like less than $10 for each. When I got them in the mail, I knew for certain that the Universe had answered my call. üíú"
I had an awesome mahogany obsidian stone I lost about 2 weeks ago. I hope a new owner found it and it's energies are helping them! At least I still have my petrified wood ‚ô•
"Smoky quartz point, very cool"
Rainbow fluorite. Beautiful
Looks like Smokey quartz to me!
"Yes, the lighter color could be impurities/ inclusions in the jade. Like chalcedony or chrysotile. Looks to be from India region."
"Is it worth $20?
-depends on what the clasps and chain are made of. If they're good quality, then yes.

Why?
-Because you can easily go to Hobby Lobby or Michaels or something and get some little amethyst gems and make your own necklace for less than that. But an experienced and/or creative jewelry maker who cares about their products might put some effort into it, and you could tell by the quality they put into it. 

For example, you can find Ammonite necklaces for $20-$30 but literally I just went to Hobby Lobby and bought an ammonite pendant for $7 and some waxed cotton chord for another $5 or so and that's good enough for me,"
"This might be an unpopular opinion to me, but $20 is cheap. Paying only $10 would just cover the cost of materials if you bought the materials locally. It probably took 30-60 minutes to assemble, so you are ""valuing"" your time. What's your time worth? $10/hr? Let's not forget the fees you pay when taking payment or hosting a stand at a local market. Anyone who's ever ran a business knows the value of your product. Consumers have been spoiled by Temu and Shein. You can't get those prices in the US, that's why they buy overseas. Duh, then expect Americans to charge Chinese prices. Insane. Nope. Don't cave to their unrealistic expectations. Charge $30 or two for $50. Then matching bracelet for $5. Your time is worth something. And BTW, Chinese can feed a family for $1000/mo total monthly bills. An ENTIRE family for $1000 plus free health care. So, you can't compare rates from China versus rates from the US. You need to be able to feed your family here in the US. Don't become a slave to the system."
"You are not an idiot - you are born of the stars. And so you must always be in oneness with your lovelies from your best, highest self. That means not putting yourself down, but approaching this from the perspective that either someone else really needed this more and the spirit of the stone knew that (and one could argue in conjunction with your higher self which knew exactly the shirts to wear to make it all happen), or 2) It felt you had gotten everything you could from it and so made a gentle exit or 3) It will make its way back to you in some fashion. 

I would also light a candle and meditate on it for a bit until you have a clear picture of it in your mind and you can feel the heart connection and then send a little prayer of gratitude to it for being with you, and telling it how much you love it and hiw special it is and how you do so want to see it again. 

Stones break and they leave. And they do sometimes come back. Blessed be the Spirit of the Stone."
"$15, and that‚Äôs only if I made it by hand and was going to sell it if a craft fair"
‚ÄúThanks. Smuggled it out of Africa in my arse‚Äù
Looks like a cookies and cream treat
Calcite is quite soft at a hardness of 3 and this stone has a hardness of 7
correct
it doesn‚Äôt have the lemony yellow tone of any lemon quartz that i‚Äôve seen
Men are not bright.
"Before you completely give up on your lost crystal, try seeing if anyone has turned it in at your job (most places have lost and found areas). You could also try asking coworkers if they've seen it... let them know it was very sentimental to you. Hopefully, someone will do the right thing and return it to you. In the future, if you're going to carry around loose crystals, I would only do so in a draw string pouch attached to a necklace (preferably)."
I would say rhodonite.   Looks like the color may be enhanced.
"Lab, Amazonite, Carnelian and can‚Äôt make out the other 3‚Ä¶. Need better pictures"
Fluorite
Agreed!
"Little steep at $20, but if it sings to you..."
Looks like Lower Grade Rhodochrosite
Druzy Agate!
Looks like Sodalite (seller here)
Aura Quartz
Rhodochrosite possibly but I doubt it lacks the white. People tend to confuse these stones. It is Rhodonite though (Seller)
"Is it actually a loop at the bottom? I thought it was just the necklace touching the sides together. But now I look at it, it does look like a loop‚Ä¶"
No way
"If it was sold by a local shop that ethically sources their crystals, definitely."
I‚Äôm leaning towards smoky quartz
I was really thinking there was something phallic about it
all rhodonite has pink in it! But yes its rhodonite
Ofc!
Ofc
I love labradorite and never seen this kind of flash in person. I‚Äôm happy with my purchase üåª
I'm gonna go with lemon quartz.
Agate bookends....lovely find!  I found my favorite amethyst at HomeGoods ;)
WOW!! If carnelian and ocean jasper snuck off and had a love rock‚Ä¶.
"Village Silversmith rocks account sells lab palms like these between $4 and $8. Smaller, reputable sellers will run $10-12."

"I have a cool phantom lab grown quartz like this! They are cool looking for sure. Definitely lab grown, but perfect pieces for planters in my house!"
"No, but that's only because I make necklaces and could do this myself. No disrespect at all, but this is simple stringing beadwork. Also, I am always very aware of things touching my skin, and these irregular chip beads distract me."
"A couple weeks ago I started sleeping with raw Celestite next to my pillow on my side table. I have been sleeping so good and dreaming vividly. I didn‚Äôt know this about Celestite before getting my  piece, but it‚Äôs supposed to be one of the best crystals for sleep. I can attest it has been highly noticeable since I got mine. Gorgeous piece you have!"
"I'm sorry for your loss.   Be careful.  There may be fiberglass or sharp crystals.

Edit:  It looks like glued crystals (possibly lab grown) with spiky, sharp lab grown crystals covering the glued areas.   Here's one without the extra added crystals.

This is the cutest!
"I‚Äôm in the US Midwest in a college town. For a necklace that length, at a local shop, it would go for $30. So I‚Äôd gladly pay $20."
Ohhh that is perfect!
"My first amethyst, i found a chipped heart in a parking lot. I love it so much, and I give thanks to the person who lost it, whoever they may be."
"My friend made me a gem and wire pendant and like to carry it with me instead of wearing it I found a small drawstring bag amongst my things from a crystal purchase and now i carry the pendant around w a couple of other tiny stones. 

So I still go to check all day to, make sure it's still in my pocket, but it's working for now- one time I lost the pendanit for a few days in the house and boy, i was devastated. 

You're not an idiot for this happening, not at all.  It's just a lesson learned about pokey pieces in you pocket.

It's okay to be really upset. But you'll find another, new piece to cherish."
Calcite???
that‚Äôs a happy accident! someone else can enjoy it now
That‚Äôs a hard no for me.
I read up on it and the article said only some fluorite reacts :0 but definitely want to try!

"Just the other day, I put a pearl necklace on my orange tabby and asked him if he was a pearl boy. Within seconds he had maneuvered the necklace around his torso. I chased him around four different rooms trying to help him get it off and finally caught him when he was distracted as he was chewing and pulling on my brand new $4 estate sale REAL pearl necklace (score). That necklace was on its last life, mere moments from being snapped and pearls strewn about my living room which was also scary because he likes to grab tiny rolling objects and run away with them in his little mouth (AirPods, rings, beads) so I also saved him from choking. It was an intense 30 seconds but lessons were learned.

Cats don‚Äôt like accessories, but it would be cute if they did."
If it was in front of me right now I definitely would give $20 to have that!!! (CAD) It looks beautiful I love amethyst
You can use Google to find out like there's an üëÅ thingy look in your photos pull the picture up and look in the upper right hand corner.
Crystal shops tend to overprice a lot of the things they sell! I personally think if you really love it then it‚Äôs worth it though . But in my opinion I wouldn‚Äôt pay more than $10-$15 for that necklace. It‚Äôs pretty but it‚Äôs not a super unique kind of crystal and they are all so small.
Good idea about videos!!  Thank you!
"That‚Äôs what I tell myself when I lose things, it does take away the sting a bit!"
Most definitely unakite..
No. I could make that myself for like $2.
"It was at some type of convention or warehouse sale, there were many vendors. It was so cool!"
But be aware: They often are pricey.
Look for Zuni fetishes in Google.
Very cool! Did you dig that piece or order it? I've done both... lol. I've got some Scolcite that I would never be able to find in the USA. Found at a local trade show.
"I hope I find the jade coffin, sounds amazing!"
"Nice bunch! I carry a medicine bag, as well, and in it I carry a bear fetish in turquoise, two crystals, and a small swath of hair (my granddaughter‚Äôs)."

Thanks!!
Unfortunate but you never know how much someone else might have needed a little light in their life. I actually carry them all the time & occasionally I'll give them as gifts to random strangers I think need them. I have always had people really grateful & happy to get them. Maybe someone needed it more than you today. The Universe works in strange but magical ways like that. üí´üíõüí´
Unikite
If it is hand made and with real stone it worth probably more than $25 depending on the type of stone. If it is a cheap chinese plastic crap I wll give away and I will not pay a single dollar.
Sounds like you like pretty specimens like me.
Yes i would pay 20. Ive paid 10 for amethyst bracelets

"Smoky quartz point, very cool"
Rainbow fluorite. Beautiful
Looks like Smokey quartz to me!
"Yes, the lighter color could be impurities/ inclusions in the jade. Like chalcedony or chrysotile. Looks to be from India region."
"Is it worth $20?
-depends on what the clasps and chain are made of. If they're good quality, then yes.

Why?
-Because you can easily go to Hobby Lobby or Michaels or something and get some little amethyst gems and make your own necklace for less than that. But an experienced and/or creative jewelry maker who cares about their products might put some effort into it, and you could tell by the quality they put into it. 

For example, you can find Ammonite necklaces for $20-$30 but literally I just went to Hobby Lobby and bought an ammonite pendant for $7 and some waxed cotton chord for another $5 or so and that's good enough for me,"
"This might be an unpopular opinion to me, but $20 is cheap. Paying only $10 would just cover the cost of materials if you bought the materials locally. It probably took 30-60 minutes to assemble, so you are ""valuing"" your time. What's your time worth? $10/hr? Let's not forget the fees you pay when taking payment or hosting a stand at a local market. Anyone who's ever ran a business knows the value of your product. Consumers have been spoiled by Temu and Shein. You can't get those prices in the US, that's why they buy overseas. Duh, then expect Americans to charge Chinese prices. Insane. Nope. Don't cave to their unrealistic expectations. Charge $30 or two for $50. Then matching bracelet for $5. Your time is worth something. And BTW, Chinese can feed a family for $1000/mo total monthly bills. An ENTIRE family for $1000 plus free health care. So, you can't compare rates from China versus rates from the US. You need to be able to feed your family here in the US. Don't become a slave to the system."
"You are not an idiot - you are born of the stars. And so you must always be in oneness with your lovelies from your best, highest self. That means not putting yourself down, but approaching this from the perspective that either someone else really needed this more and the spirit of the stone knew that (and one could argue in conjunction with your higher self which knew exactly the shirts to wear to make it all happen), or 2) It felt you had gotten everything you could from it and so made a gentle exit or 3) It will make its way back to you in some fashion. 

I would also light a candle and meditate on it for a bit until you have a clear picture of it in your mind and you can feel the heart connection and then send a little prayer of gratitude to it for being with you, and telling it how much you love it and hiw special it is and how you do so want to see it again. 

Stones break and they leave. And they do sometimes come back. Blessed be the Spirit of the Stone."
"$15, and that‚Äôs only if I made it by hand and was going to sell it if a craft fair"
‚ÄúThanks. Smuggled it out of Africa in my arse‚Äù
Looks like a cookies and cream treat
Calcite is quite soft at a hardness of 3 and this stone has a hardness of 7
correct
it doesn‚Äôt have the lemony yellow tone of any lemon quartz that i‚Äôve seen
Men are not bright.
"Before you completely give up on your lost crystal, try seeing if anyone has turned it in at your job (most places have lost and found areas). You could also try asking coworkers if they've seen it... let them know it was very sentimental to you. Hopefully, someone will do the right thing and return it to you. In the future, if you're going to carry around loose crystals, I would only do so in a draw string pouch attached to a necklace (preferably)."
I would say rhodonite.   Looks like the color may be enhanced.
"Lab, Amazonite, Carnelian and can‚Äôt make out the other 3‚Ä¶. Need better pictures"
Fluorite
Agreed!
"Little steep at $20, but if it sings to you..."
Looks like Lower Grade Rhodochrosite
Druzy Agate!
Looks like Sodalite (seller here)
Aura Quartz
Rhodochrosite possibly but I doubt it lacks the white. People tend to confuse these stones. It is Rhodonite though (Seller)
"Is it actually a loop at the bottom? I thought it was just the necklace touching the sides together. But now I look at it, it does look like a loop‚Ä¶"
No way
"If it was sold by a local shop that ethically sources their crystals, definitely."
I‚Äôm leaning towards smoky quartz
I was really thinking there was something phallic about it
all rhodonite has pink in it! But yes its rhodonite
Ofc!
Ofc
I love labradorite and never seen this kind of flash in person. I‚Äôm happy with my purchase üåª
I'm gonna go with lemon quartz.
Agate bookends....lovely find!  I found my favorite amethyst at HomeGoods ;)
WOW!! If carnelian and ocean jasper snuck off and had a love rock‚Ä¶.
"Village Silversmith rocks account sells lab palms like these between $4 and $8. Smaller, reputable sellers will run $10-12."
15$
"I have a cool phantom lab grown quartz like this! They are cool looking for sure. Definitely lab grown, but perfect pieces for planters in my house!"
"No, but that's only because I make necklaces and could do this myself. No disrespect at all, but this is simple stringing beadwork. Also, I am always very aware of things touching my skin, and these irregular chip beads distract me."
"A couple weeks ago I started sleeping with raw Celestite next to my pillow on my side table. I have been sleeping so good and dreaming vividly. I didn‚Äôt know this about Celestite before getting my  piece, but it‚Äôs supposed to be one of the best crystals for sleep. I can attest it has been highly noticeable since I got mine. Gorgeous piece you have!"
"I'm sorry for your loss.   Be careful.  There may be fiberglass or sharp crystals.

Edit:  It looks like glued crystals (possibly lab grown) with spiky, sharp lab grown crystals covering the glued areas.   Here's one without the extra added crystals.

This is the cutest!
"I‚Äôm in the US Midwest in a college town. For a necklace that length, at a local shop, it would go for $30. So I‚Äôd gladly pay $20."
Ohhh that is perfect!
"My first amethyst, i found a chipped heart in a parking lot. I love it so much, and I give thanks to the person who lost it, whoever they may be."
"My friend made me a gem and wire pendant and like to carry it with me instead of wearing it I found a small drawstring bag amongst my things from a crystal purchase and now i carry the pendant around w a couple of other tiny stones. 

So I still go to check all day to, make sure it's still in my pocket, but it's working for now- one time I lost the pendanit for a few days in the house and boy, i was devastated. 

You're not an idiot for this happening, not at all.  It's just a lesson learned about pokey pieces in you pocket.

It's okay to be really upset. But you'll find another, new piece to cherish."
Calcite???
that‚Äôs a happy accident! someone else can enjoy it now
That‚Äôs a hard no for me.
I read up on it and the article said only some fluorite reacts :0 but definitely want to try!

"Just the other day, I put a pearl necklace on my orange tabby and asked him if he was a pearl boy. Within seconds he had maneuvered the necklace around his torso. I chased him around four different rooms trying to help him get it off and finally caught him when he was distracted as he was chewing and pulling on my brand new $4 estate sale REAL pearl necklace (score). That necklace was on its last life, mere moments from being snapped and pearls strewn about my living room which was also scary because he likes to grab tiny rolling objects and run away with them in his little mouth (AirPods, rings, beads) so I also saved him from choking. It was an intense 30 seconds but lessons were learned.

Cats don‚Äôt like accessories, but it would be cute if they did."
If it was in front of me right now I definitely would give $20 to have that!!! (CAD) It looks beautiful I love amethyst
You can use Google to find out like there's an üëÅ thingy look in your photos pull the picture up and look in the upper right hand corner.
Crystal shops tend to overprice a lot of the things they sell! I personally think if you really love it then it‚Äôs worth it though . But in my opinion I wouldn‚Äôt pay more than $10-$15 for that necklace. It‚Äôs pretty but it‚Äôs not a super unique kind of crystal and they are all so small.
Good idea about videos!!  Thank you!
"That‚Äôs what I tell myself when I lose things, it does take away the sting a bit!"
Most definitely unakite..
No. I could make that myself for like $2.
"It was at some type of convention or warehouse sale, there were many vendors. It was so cool!"
But be aware: They often are pricey.
Look for Zuni fetishes in Google.
Very cool! Did you dig that piece or order it? I've done both... lol. I've got some Scolcite that I would never be able to find in the USA. Found at a local trade show.
"I hope I find the jade coffin, sounds amazing!"
"Nice bunch! I carry a medicine bag, as well, and in it I carry a bear fetish in turquoise, two crystals, and a small swath of hair (my granddaughter‚Äôs)."

Unfortunate but you never know how much someone else might have needed a little light in their life. I actually carry them all the time & occasionally I'll give them as gifts to random strangers I think need them. I have always had people really grateful & happy to get them. Maybe someone needed it more than you today. The Universe works in strange but magical ways like that. üí´üíõüí´
Unikite
If it is hand made and with real stone it worth probably more than $25 depending on the type of stone. If it is a cheap chinese plastic crap I wll give away and I will not pay a single dollar.

Yes i would pay 20. Ive paid 10 for amethyst bracelets

But an experienced and/or creative jewelry maker who cares about their products might put some effort into it, and you could tell by the quality they put into it. 

For example, you can find Ammonite necklaces for $20-$30 but literally I just went to Hobby Lobby and bought an ammonite pendant for $7 and some waxed cotton chord for another $5 or so and that's good enough for me,"
"This might be an unpopular opinion to me, but $20 is cheap. Paying only $10 would just cover the cost of materials if you bought the materials locally. It probably took 30-60 minutes to assemble, so you are ""valuing"" your time. What's your time worth? $10/hr? Let's not forget the fees you pay when taking payment or hosting a stand at a local market. Anyone who's ever ran a business knows the value of your product. Consumers have been spoiled by Temu and Shein. You can't get those prices in the US, that's why they buy overseas. Duh, then expect Americans to charge Chinese prices. Insane. Nope. Don't cave to their unrealistic expectations. Charge $30 or two for $50. Then matching bracelet for $5. Your time is worth something. And BTW, Chinese can feed a family for $1000/mo total monthly bills. An ENTIRE family for $1000 plus free health care. So, you can't compare rates from China versus rates from the US. You need to be able to feed your family here in the US. Don't become a slave to the system."
"You are not an idiot - you are born of the stars. And so you must always be in oneness with your lovelies from your best, highest self. That means not putting yourself down, but approaching this from the perspective that either someone else really needed this more and the spirit of the stone knew that (and one could argue in conjunction with your higher self which knew exactly the shirts to wear to make it all happen), or 2) It felt you had gotten everything you could from it and so made a gentle exit or 3) It will make its way back to you in some fashion. 

I would also light a candle and meditate on it for a bit until you have a clear picture of it in your mind and you can feel the heart connection and then send a little prayer of gratitude to it for being with you, and telling it how much you love it and hiw special it is and how you do so want to see it again. 

Stones break and they leave. And they do sometimes come back. Blessed be the Spirit of the Stone."
"$15, and that‚Äôs only if I made it by hand and was going to sell it if a craft fair"
‚ÄúThanks. Smuggled it out of Africa in my arse‚Äù
Looks like a cookies and cream treat
Calcite is quite soft at a hardness of 3 and this stone has a hardness of 7
correct
it doesn‚Äôt have the lemony yellow tone of any lemon quartz that i‚Äôve seen
Men are not bright.
"Before you completely give up on your lost crystal, try seeing if anyone has turned it in at your job (most places have lost and found areas). You could also try asking coworkers if they've seen it... let them know it was very sentimental to you. Hopefully, someone will do the right thing and return it to you. In the future, if you're going to carry around loose crystals, I would only do so in a draw string pouch attached to a necklace (preferably)."
I would say rhodonite.   Looks like the color may be enhanced.
"Lab, Amazonite, Carnelian and can‚Äôt make out the other 3‚Ä¶. Need better pictures"
Fluorite
Agreed!
"Little steep at $20, but if it sings to you..."
Looks like Lower Grade Rhodochrosite
Druzy Agate!
Looks like Sodalite (seller here)
Aura Quartz
Rhodochrosite possibly but I doubt it lacks the white. People tend to confuse these stones. It is Rhodonite though (Seller)
"Is it actually a loop at the bottom? I thought it was just the necklace touching the sides together. But now I look at it, it does look like a loop‚Ä¶"
No way
"If it was sold by a local shop that ethically sources their crystals, definitely."
I‚Äôm leaning towards smoky quartz
I was really thinking there was something phallic about it
all rhodonite has pink in it! But yes its rhodonite
Ofc!
Ofc
I love labradorite and never seen this kind of flash in person. I‚Äôm happy with my purchase üåª
I'm gonna go with lemon quartz.
Agate bookends....lovely find!  I found my favorite amethyst at HomeGoods ;)
WOW!! If carnelian and ocean jasper snuck off and had a love rock‚Ä¶.
"Village Silversmith rocks account sells lab palms like these between $4 and $8. Smaller, reputable sellers will run $10-12."
15$
"I have a cool phantom lab grown quartz like this! They are cool looking for sure. Definitely lab grown, but perfect pieces for planters in my house!"
"No, but that's only because I make necklaces and could do this myself. No disrespect at all, but this is simple stringing beadwork. Also, I am always very aware of things touching my skin, and these irregular chip beads distract me."
"A couple weeks ago I started sleeping with raw Celestite next to my pillow on my side table. I have been sleeping so good and dreaming vividly. I didn‚Äôt know this about Celestite before getting my  piece, but it‚Äôs supposed to be one of the best crystals for sleep. I can attest it has been highly noticeable since I got mine. Gorgeous piece you have!"
"I'm sorry for your loss.   Be careful.  There may be fiberglass or sharp crystals.

Edit:  It looks like glued crystals (possibly lab grown) with spiky, sharp lab grown crystals covering the glued areas.   Here's one without the extra added crystals.

This is the cutest!
"I‚Äôm in the US Midwest in a college town. For a necklace that length, at a local shop, it would go for $30. So I‚Äôd gladly pay $20."
Ohhh that is perfect!
"My first amethyst, i found a chipped heart in a parking lot. I love it so much, and I give thanks to the person who lost it, whoever they may be."
"My friend made me a gem and wire pendant and like to carry it with me instead of wearing it I found a small drawstring bag amongst my things from a crystal purchase and now i carry the pendant around w a couple of other tiny stones. 

So I still go to check all day to, make sure it's still in my pocket, but it's working for now- one time I lost the pendanit for a few days in the house and boy, i was devastated. 

You're not an idiot for this happening, not at all.  It's just a lesson learned about pokey pieces in you pocket.

It's okay to be really upset. But you'll find another, new piece to cherish."
Calcite???
that‚Äôs a happy accident! someone else can enjoy it now
That‚Äôs a hard no for me.
I read up on it and the article said only some fluorite reacts :0 but definitely want to try!

"Just the other day, I put a pearl necklace on my orange tabby and asked him if he was a pearl boy. Within seconds he had maneuvered the necklace around his torso. I chased him around four different rooms trying to help him get it off and finally caught him when he was distracted as he was chewing and pulling on my brand new $4 estate sale REAL pearl necklace (score). That necklace was on its last life, mere moments from being snapped and pearls strewn about my living room which was also scary because he likes to grab tiny rolling objects and run away with them in his little mouth (AirPods, rings, beads) so I also saved him from choking. It was an intense 30 seconds but lessons were learned.

Cats don‚Äôt like accessories, but it would be cute if they did."
If it was in front of me right now I definitely would give $20 to have that!!! (CAD) It looks beautiful I love amethyst
You can use Google to find out like there's an üëÅ thingy look in your photos pull the picture up and look in the upper right hand corner.
Crystal shops tend to overprice a lot of the things they sell! I personally think if you really love it then it‚Äôs worth it though . But in my opinion I wouldn‚Äôt pay more than $10-$15 for that necklace. It‚Äôs pretty but it‚Äôs not a super unique kind of crystal and they are all so small.
Good idea about videos!!  Thank you!
"That‚Äôs what I tell myself when I lose things, it does take away the sting a bit!"
Most definitely unakite..
No. I could make that myself for like $2.
"It was at some type of convention or warehouse sale, there were many vendors. It was so cool!"
But be aware: They often are pricey.
Look for Zuni fetishes in Google.
Very cool! Did you dig that piece or order it? I've done both... lol. I've got some Scolcite that I would never be able to find in the USA. Found at a local trade show.
"I hope I find the jade coffin, sounds amazing!"
"Nice bunch! I carry a medicine bag, as well, and in it I carry a bear fetish in turquoise, two crystals, and a small swath of hair (my granddaughter‚Äôs)."

Thanks!!
Unfortunate but you never know how much someone else might have needed a little light in their life. I actually carry them all the time & occasionally I'll give them as gifts to random strangers I think need them. I have always had people really grateful & happy to get them. Maybe someone needed it more than you today. The Universe works in strange but magical ways like that. üí´üíõüí´
Unikite
If it is hand made and with real stone it worth probably more than $25 depending on the type of stone. If it is a cheap chinese plastic crap I wll give away and I will not pay a single dollar.
Sounds like you like pretty specimens like me.
Yes i would pay 20. Ive paid 10 for amethyst bracelets

Don't cave to their unrealistic expectations. Charge $30 or two for $50. Then matching bracelet for $5. Your time is worth something. And BTW, Chinese can feed a family for $1000/mo total monthly bills. An ENTIRE family for $1000 plus free health care. So, you can't compare rates from China versus rates from the US. You need to be able to feed your family here in the US. Don't become a slave to the system."
"You are not an idiot - you are born of the stars. And so you must always be in oneness with your lovelies from your best, highest self. That means not putting yourself down, but approaching this from the perspective that either someone else really needed this more and the spirit of the stone knew that (and one could argue in conjunction with your higher self which knew exactly the shirts to wear to make it all happen), or 2) It felt you had gotten everything you could from it and so made a gentle exit or 3) It will make its way back to you in some fashion. 

I would also light a candle and meditate on it for a bit until you have a clear picture of it in your mind and you can feel the heart connection and then send a little prayer of gratitude to it for being with you, and telling it how much you love it and hiw special it is and how you do so want to see it again. 

Stones break and they leave. And they do sometimes come back. Blessed be the Spirit of the Stone."

Calcite is quite soft at a hardness of 3 and this stone has a hardness of 7
correct
it doesn‚Äôt have the lemony yellow tone of any lemon quartz that i‚Äôve seen
Men are not bright.
"Before you completely give up on your lost crystal, try seeing if anyone has turned it in at your job (most places have lost and found areas). You could also try asking coworkers if they've seen it... let them know it was very sentimental to you. Hopefully, someone will do the right thing and return it to you. In the future, if you're going to carry around loose crystals, I would only do so in a draw string pouch attached to a necklace (preferably)."

Rhodochrosite possibly but I doubt it lacks the white. People tend to confuse these stones. It is Rhodonite though (Seller)

Ofc!

I love labradorite and never seen this kind of flash in person. I‚Äôm happy with my purchase üåª
I'm gonna go with lemon quartz.

You're not an idiot for this happening, not at all.  It's just a lesson learned about pokey pieces in you pocket.

It's okay to be really upset. But you'll find another, new piece to cherish."

That‚Äôs a hard no for me.

I chased him around four different rooms trying to help him get it off and finally caught him when he was distracted as he was chewing and pulling on my brand new $4 estate sale REAL pearl necklace (score). That necklace was on its last life, mere moments from being snapped and pearls strewn about my living room which was also scary because he likes to grab tiny rolling objects and run away with them in his little mouth (AirPods, rings, beads) so I also saved him from choking. It was an intense 30 seconds but lessons were learned.

Cats don‚Äôt like accessories, but it would be cute if they did."
If it was in front of me right now I definitely would give $20 to have that!!! (CAD) It looks beautiful I love amethyst
You can use Google to find out like there's an üëÅ thingy look in your photos pull the picture up and look in the upper right hand corner.
Crystal shops tend to overprice a lot of the things they sell! I personally think if you really love it then it‚Äôs worth it though . But in my opinion I wouldn‚Äôt pay more than $10-$15 for that necklace. It‚Äôs pretty but it‚Äôs not a super unique kind of crystal and they are all so small.
Good idea about videos!!  Thank you!
"That‚Äôs what I tell myself when I lose things, it does take away the sting a bit!"
Most definitely unakite..
No. I could make that myself for like $2.
"It was at some type of convention or warehouse sale, there were many vendors. It was so cool!"
But be aware: They often are pricey.
Look for Zuni fetishes in Google.
Very cool! Did you dig that piece or order it? I've done both... lol. I've got some Scolcite that I would never be able to find in the USA. Found at a local trade show.

Unfortunate but you never know how much someone else might have needed a little light in their life. I actually carry them all the time & occasionally I'll give them as gifts to random strangers I think need them. I have always had people really grateful & happy to get them.

If it is hand made and with real stone it worth probably more than $25 depending on the type of stone. If it is a cheap chinese plastic crap I wll give away and I will not pay a single dollar.

"Is it worth $20?

Why?
-Because you can easily go to Hobby Lobby or Michaels or something and get some little amethyst gems and make your own necklace for less than that.

It's okay to be really upset. But you'll find another, new piece to cherish."

I chased him around four different rooms trying to help him get it off and finally caught him when he was distracted as he was chewing and pulling on my brand new $4 estate sale REAL pearl necklace (score). That necklace was on its last life, mere moments from being snapped and pearls strewn about my living room which was also scary because he likes to grab tiny rolling objects and run away with them in his little mouth (AirPods, rings, beads) so I also saved him from choking. It was an intense 30 seconds but lessons were learned.

If it was in front of me right now I definitely would give $20 to have that!!! (CAD) It looks beautiful I love amethyst
You can use Google to find out like there's an üëÅ thingy look in your photos pull the picture up and look in the upper right hand corner.
Crystal shops tend to overprice a lot of the things they sell! I personally think if you really love it then it‚Äôs worth it though . But in my opinion I wouldn‚Äôt pay more than $10-$15 for that necklace. It‚Äôs pretty but it‚Äôs not a super unique kind of crystal and they are all so small.
Good idea about videos!!  Thank you!
"That‚Äôs what I tell myself when I lose things, it does take away the sting a bit!"

No. I could make that myself for like $2.

But be aware: They often are pricey.

Unfortunate but you never know how much someone else might have needed a little light in their life.

If it is hand made and with real stone it worth probably more than $25 depending on the type of stone. If it is a cheap chinese plastic crap I wll give away and I will not pay a single dollar.

"Yes, the lighter color could be impurities/ inclusions in the jade. Like chalcedony or chrysotile. Looks to be from India region."
"Is it worth $20?
-depends on what the clasps and chain are made of. If they're good quality, then yes.

Why?
-Because you can easily go to Hobby Lobby or Michaels or something and get some little amethyst gems and make your own necklace for less than that. But an experienced and/or creative jewelry maker who cares about their products might put some effort into it, and you could tell by the quality they put into it. 

For example, you can find Ammonite necklaces for $20-$30 but literally I just went to Hobby Lobby and bought an ammonite pendant for $7 and some waxed cotton chord for another $5 or so and that's good enough for me,"
"This might be an unpopular opinion to me, but $20 is cheap. Paying only $10 would just cover the cost of materials if you bought the materials locally. It probably took 30-60 minutes to assemble, so you are ""valuing"" your time. What's your time worth? $10/hr? Let's not forget the fees you pay when taking payment or hosting a stand at a local market. Anyone who's ever ran a business knows the value of your product. Consumers have been spoiled by Temu and Shein. You can't get those prices in the US, that's why they buy overseas. Duh, then expect Americans to charge Chinese prices. Insane. Nope. Don't cave to their unrealistic expectations. Charge $30 or two for $50. Then matching bracelet for $5. Your time is worth something. And BTW, Chinese can feed a family for $1000/mo total monthly bills. An ENTIRE family for $1000 plus free health care. So, you can't compare rates from China versus rates from the US. You need to be able to feed your family here in the US. Don't become a slave to the system."

"Before you completely give up on your lost crystal, try seeing if anyone has turned it in at your job (most places have lost and found areas). You could also try asking coworkers if they've seen it... let them know it was very sentimental to you. Hopefully, someone will do the right thing and return it to you. In the future, if you're going to carry around loose crystals, I would only do so in a draw string pouch attached to a necklace (preferably)."

Rhodochrosite possibly but I doubt it lacks the white. People tend to confuse these stones. It is Rhodonite though (Seller)

all rhodonite has pink in it! But yes its rhodonite
Ofc!

I love labradorite and never seen this kind of flash in person. I‚Äôm happy with my purchase üåª
I'm gonna go with lemon quartz.

"A couple weeks ago I started sleeping with raw Celestite next to my pillow on my side table. I have been sleeping so good and dreaming vividly.

Gorgeous piece you have!"
"I'm sorry for your loss.   Be careful.  There may be fiberglass or sharp crystals.

Ohhh that is perfect!
"My first amethyst, i found a chipped heart in a parking lot. I love it so much, and I give thanks to the person who lost it, whoever they may be."
"My friend made me a gem and wire pendant and like to carry it with me instead of wearing it I found a small drawstring bag amongst my things from a crystal purchase and now i carry the pendant around w a couple of other tiny stones. 

So I still go to check all day to, make sure it's still in my pocket, but it's working for now- one time I lost the pendanit for a few days in the house and boy, i was devastated. 

You're not an idiot for this happening, not at all.  It's just a lesson learned about pokey pieces in you pocket.

It's okay to be really upset. But you'll find another, new piece to cherish."
Calcite???
that‚Äôs a happy accident! someone else can enjoy it now
That‚Äôs a hard no for me.
I read up on it and the article said only some fluorite reacts :0 but definitely want to try!

"Just the other day, I put a pearl necklace on my orange tabby and asked him if he was a pearl boy. Within seconds he had maneuvered the necklace around his torso. I chased him around four different rooms trying to help him get it off and finally caught him when he was distracted as he was chewing and pulling on my brand new $4 estate sale REAL pearl necklace (score). That necklace was on its last life, mere moments from being snapped and pearls strewn about my living room which was also scary because he likes to grab tiny rolling objects and run away with them in his little mouth (AirPods, rings, beads) so I also saved him from choking. It was an intense 30 seconds but lessons were learned.

Cats don‚Äôt like accessories, but it would be cute if they did."
If it was in front of me right now I definitely would give $20 to have that!!! (CAD) It looks beautiful I love amethyst
You can use Google to find out like there's an üëÅ thingy look in your photos pull the picture up and look in the upper right hand corner.
Crystal shops tend to overprice a lot of the things they sell! I personally think if you really love it then it‚Äôs worth it though . But in my opinion I wouldn‚Äôt pay more than $10-$15 for that necklace. It‚Äôs pretty but it‚Äôs not a super unique kind of crystal and they are all so small.
Good idea about videos!!  Thank you!
"That‚Äôs what I tell myself when I lose things, it does take away the sting a bit!"
Most definitely unakite..
No. I could make that myself for like $2.
"It was at some type of convention or warehouse sale, there were many vendors. It was so cool!"
But be aware: They often are pricey.
Look for Zuni fetishes in Google.
Very cool! Did you dig that piece or order it? I've done both... lol. I've got some Scolcite that I would never be able to find in the USA. Found at a local trade show.
"I hope I find the jade coffin, sounds amazing!"
"Nice bunch! I carry a medicine bag, as well, and in it I carry a bear fetish in turquoise, two crystals, and a small swath of hair (my granddaughter‚Äôs)."

Unfortunate but you never know how much someone else might have needed a little light in their life. I actually carry them all the time & occasionally I'll give them as gifts to random strangers I think need them. I have always had people really grateful & happy to get them.

If it is hand made and with real stone it worth probably more than $25 depending on the type of stone. If it is a cheap chinese plastic crap I wll give away and I will not pay a single dollar.

"Yes, the lighter color could be impurities/ inclusions in the jade. Like chalcedony or chrysotile. Looks to be from India region."
"Is it worth $20?
-depends on what the clasps and chain are made of. If they're good quality, then yes.

Why?
-Because you can easily go to Hobby Lobby or Michaels or something and get some little amethyst gems and make your own necklace for less than that. But an experienced and/or creative jewelry maker who cares about their products might put some effort into it, and you could tell by the quality they put into it. 

For example, you can find Ammonite necklaces for $20-$30 but literally I just went to Hobby Lobby and bought an ammonite pendant for $7 and some waxed cotton chord for another $5 or so and that's good enough for me,"
"This might be an unpopular opinion to me, but $20 is cheap. Paying only $10 would just cover the cost of materials if you bought the materials locally. It probably took 30-60 minutes to assemble, so you are ""valuing"" your time. What's your time worth? $10/hr? Let's not forget the fees you pay when taking payment or hosting a stand at a local market. Anyone who's ever ran a business knows the value of your product. Consumers have been spoiled by Temu and Shein. You can't get those prices in the US, that's why they buy overseas. Duh, then expect Americans to charge Chinese prices. Insane. Nope. Don't cave to their unrealistic expectations. Charge $30 or two for $50. Then matching bracelet for $5. Your time is worth something. And BTW, Chinese can feed a family for $1000/mo total monthly bills. An ENTIRE family for $1000 plus free health care. So, you can't compare rates from China versus rates from the US. You need to be able to feed your family here in the US. Don't become a slave to the system."
"You are not an idiot - you are born of the stars. And so you must always be in oneness with your lovelies from your best, highest self. That means not putting yourself down, but approaching this from the perspective that either someone else really needed this more and the spirit of the stone knew that (and one could argue in conjunction with your higher self which knew exactly the shirts to wear to make it all happen), or 2) It felt you had gotten everything you could from it and so made a gentle exit or 3) It will make its way back to you in some fashion. 

I would also light a candle and meditate on it for a bit until you have a clear picture of it in your mind and you can feel the heart connection and then send a little prayer of gratitude to it for being with you, and telling it how much you love it and hiw special it is and how you do so want to see it again. 

Stones break and they leave. And they do sometimes come back. Blessed be the Spirit of the Stone."

You're not an idiot for this happening, not at all.  It's just a lesson learned about pokey pieces in you pocket.

It's okay to be really upset. But you'll find another, new piece to cherish."
Calcite???

That‚Äôs a hard no for me.

"Just the other day, I put a pearl necklace on my orange tabby and asked him if he was a pearl boy. Within seconds he had maneuvered the necklace around his torso. I chased him around four different rooms trying to help him get it off and finally caught him when he was distracted as he was chewing and pulling on my brand new $4 estate sale REAL pearl necklace (score). That necklace was on its last life, mere moments from being snapped and pearls strewn about my living room which was also scary because he likes to grab tiny rolling objects and run away with them in his little mouth (AirPods, rings, beads) so I also saved him from choking. It was an intense 30 seconds but lessons were learned.

Cats don‚Äôt like accessories, but it would be cute if they did."
If it was in front of me right now I definitely would give $20 to have that!!! (CAD) It looks beautiful I love amethyst
You can use Google to find out like there's an üëÅ thingy look in your photos pull the picture up and look in the upper right hand corner.
Crystal shops tend to overprice a lot of the things they sell! I personally think if you really love it then it‚Äôs worth it though . But in my opinion I wouldn‚Äôt pay more than $10-$15 for that necklace. It‚Äôs pretty but it‚Äôs not a super unique kind of crystal and they are all so small.
Good idea about videos!!  Thank you!
"That‚Äôs what I tell myself when I lose things, it does take away the sting a bit!"
Most definitely unakite..
No. I could make that myself for like $2.

But be aware: They often are pricey.
Look for Zuni fetishes in Google.
Very cool! Did you dig that piece or order it? I've done both... lol. I've got some Scolcite that I would never be able to find in the USA. Found at a local trade show.

Unfortunate but you never know how much someone else might have needed a little light in their life.

Rainbow fluorite. Beautiful
Looks like Smokey quartz to me!
"Yes, the lighter color could be impurities/ inclusions in the jade. Like chalcedony or chrysotile. Looks to be from India region."
"Is it worth $20?
-depends on what the clasps and chain are made of. If they're good quality, then yes.

Why?
-Because you can easily go to Hobby Lobby or Michaels or something and get some little amethyst gems and make your own necklace for less than that. But an experienced and/or creative jewelry maker who cares about their products might put some effort into it, and you could tell by the quality they put into it. 

For example, you can find Ammonite necklaces for $20-$30 but literally I just went to Hobby Lobby and bought an ammonite pendant for $7 and some waxed cotton chord for another $5 or so and that's good enough for me,"
"This might be an unpopular opinion to me, but $20 is cheap. Paying only $10 would just cover the cost of materials if you bought the materials locally. It probably took 30-60 minutes to assemble, so you are ""valuing"" your time. What's your time worth? $10/hr? Let's not forget the fees you pay when taking payment or hosting a stand at a local market. Anyone who's ever ran a business knows the value of your product. Consumers have been spoiled by Temu and Shein. You can't get those prices in the US, that's why they buy overseas. Duh, then expect Americans to charge Chinese prices. Insane. Nope. Don't cave to their unrealistic expectations. Charge $30 or two for $50. Then matching bracelet for $5. Your time is worth something. And BTW, Chinese can feed a family for $1000/mo total monthly bills. An ENTIRE family for $1000 plus free health care. So, you can't compare rates from China versus rates from the US. You need to be able to feed your family here in the US. Don't become a slave to the system."
"You are not an idiot - you are born of the stars. And so you must always be in oneness with your lovelies from your best, highest self. That means not putting yourself down, but approaching this from the perspective that either someone else really needed this more and the spirit of the stone knew that (and one could argue in conjunction with your higher self which knew exactly the shirts to wear to make it all happen), or 2) It felt you had gotten everything you could from it and so made a gentle exit or 3) It will make its way back to you in some fashion. 

I would also light a candle and meditate on it for a bit until you have a clear picture of it in your mind and you can feel the heart connection and then send a little prayer of gratitude to it for being with you, and telling it how much you love it and hiw special it is and how you do so want to see it again. 

Stones break and they leave. And they do sometimes come back. Blessed be the Spirit of the Stone."

You're not an idiot for this happening, not at all.  It's just a lesson learned about pokey pieces in you pocket.

It's okay to be really upset. But you'll find another, new piece to cherish."
Calcite???
that‚Äôs a happy accident! someone else can enjoy it now
That‚Äôs a hard no for me.

"Just the other day, I put a pearl necklace on my orange tabby and asked him if he was a pearl boy. Within seconds he had maneuvered the necklace around his torso. I chased him around four different rooms trying to help him get it off and finally caught him when he was distracted as he was chewing and pulling on my brand new $4 estate sale REAL pearl necklace (score). That necklace was on its last life, mere moments from being snapped and pearls strewn about my living room which was also scary because he likes to grab tiny rolling objects and run away with them in his little mouth (AirPods, rings, beads) so I also saved him from choking. It was an intense 30 seconds but lessons were learned.

Cats don‚Äôt like accessories, but it would be cute if they did."
If it was in front of me right now I definitely would give $20 to have that!!! (CAD) It looks beautiful I love amethyst
You can use Google to find out like there's an üëÅ thingy look in your photos pull the picture up and look in the upper right hand corner.
Crystal shops tend to overprice a lot of the things they sell! I personally think if you really love it then it‚Äôs worth it though . But in my opinion I wouldn‚Äôt pay more than $10-$15 for that necklace. It‚Äôs pretty but it‚Äôs not a super unique kind of crystal and they are all so small.
Good idea about videos!!  Thank you!
"That‚Äôs what I tell myself when I lose things, it does take away the sting a bit!"

No. I could make that myself for like $2.

But be aware: They often are pricey.

Very cool! Did you dig that piece or order it? I've done both... lol. I've got some Scolcite that I would never be able to find in the USA. Found at a local trade show.

Unfortunate but you never know how much someone else might have needed a little light in their life.

If it is hand made and with real stone it worth probably more than $25 depending on the type of stone. If it is a cheap chinese plastic crap I wll give away and I will not pay a single dollar.

"Smoky quartz point, very cool"
Rainbow fluorite. Beautiful
Looks like Smokey quartz to me!
"Yes, the lighter color could be impurities/ inclusions in the jade. Like chalcedony or chrysotile. Looks to be from India region."
"Is it worth $20?
-depends on what the clasps and chain are made of. If they're good quality, then yes.

Why?
-Because you can easily go to Hobby Lobby or Michaels or something and get some little amethyst gems and make your own necklace for less than that. But an experienced and/or creative jewelry maker who cares about their products might put some effort into it, and you could tell by the quality they put into it. 

For example, you can find Ammonite necklaces for $20-$30 but literally I just went to Hobby Lobby and bought an ammonite pendant for $7 and some waxed cotton chord for another $5 or so and that's good enough for me,"
"This might be an unpopular opinion to me, but $20 is cheap. Paying only $10 would just cover the cost of materials if you bought the materials locally. It probably took 30-60 minutes to assemble, so you are ""valuing"" your time. What's your time worth? $10/hr? Let's not forget the fees you pay when taking payment or hosting a stand at a local market. Anyone who's ever ran a business knows the value of your product. Consumers have been spoiled by Temu and Shein. You can't get those prices in the US, that's why they buy overseas. Duh, then expect Americans to charge Chinese prices. Insane. Nope. Don't cave to their unrealistic expectations. Charge $30 or two for $50. Then matching bracelet for $5. Your time is worth something. And BTW, Chinese can feed a family for $1000/mo total monthly bills. An ENTIRE family for $1000 plus free health care. So, you can't compare rates from China versus rates from the US. You need to be able to feed your family here in the US. Don't become a slave to the system."
"You are not an idiot - you are born of the stars. And so you must always be in oneness with your lovelies from your best, highest self. That means not putting yourself down, but approaching this from the perspective that either someone else really needed this more and the spirit of the stone knew that (and one could argue in conjunction with your higher self which knew exactly the shirts to wear to make it all happen), or 2) It felt you had gotten everything you could from it and so made a gentle exit or 3) It will make its way back to you in some fashion. 

I would also light a candle and meditate on it for a bit until you have a clear picture of it in your mind and you can feel the heart connection and then send a little prayer of gratitude to it for being with you, and telling it how much you love it and hiw special it is and how you do so want to see it again. 

Stones break and they leave. And they do sometimes come back. Blessed be the Spirit of the Stone."

It's okay to be really upset. But you'll find another, new piece to cherish."

I chased him around four different rooms trying to help him get it off and finally caught him when he was distracted as he was chewing and pulling on my brand new $4 estate sale REAL pearl necklace (score). That necklace was on its last life, mere moments from being snapped and pearls strewn about my living room which was also scary because he likes to grab tiny rolling objects and run away with them in his little mouth (AirPods, rings, beads) so I also saved him from choking. It was an intense 30 seconds but lessons were learned.

If it was in front of me right now I definitely would give $20 to have that!!! (CAD) It looks beautiful I love amethyst
You can use Google to find out like there's an üëÅ thingy look in your photos pull the picture up and look in the upper right hand corner.
Crystal shops tend to overprice a lot of the things they sell! I personally think if you really love it then it‚Äôs worth it though . But in my opinion I wouldn‚Äôt pay more than $10-$15 for that necklace. It‚Äôs pretty but it‚Äôs not a super unique kind of crystal and they are all so small.
Good idea about videos!!  Thank you!

Unfortunate but you never know how much someone else might have needed a little light in their life.

If it is hand made and with real stone it worth probably more than $25 depending on the type of stone. If it is a cheap chinese plastic crap I wll give away and I will not pay a single dollar.

"Smoky quartz point, very cool"
Rainbow fluorite. Beautiful
Looks like Smokey quartz to me!
"Yes, the lighter color could be impurities/ inclusions in the jade. Like chalcedony or chrysotile. Looks to be from India region."
"Is it worth $20?
-depends on what the clasps and chain are made of. If they're good quality, then yes.

Why?
-Because you can easily go to Hobby Lobby or Michaels or something and get some little amethyst gems and make your own necklace for less than that. But an experienced and/or creative jewelry maker who cares about their products might put some effort into it, and you could tell by the quality they put into it. 

For example, you can find Ammonite necklaces for $20-$30 but literally I just went to Hobby Lobby and bought an ammonite pendant for $7 and some waxed cotton chord for another $5 or so and that's good enough for me,"
"This might be an unpopular opinion to me, but $20 is cheap. Paying only $10 would just cover the cost of materials if you bought the materials locally. It probably took 30-60 minutes to assemble, so you are ""valuing"" your time. What's your time worth? $10/hr? Let's not forget the fees you pay when taking payment or hosting a stand at a local market. Anyone who's ever ran a business knows the value of your product. Consumers have been spoiled by Temu and Shein. You can't get those prices in the US, that's why they buy overseas. Duh, then expect Americans to charge Chinese prices. Insane. Nope. Don't cave to their unrealistic expectations. Charge $30 or two for $50. Then matching bracelet for $5. Your time is worth something. And BTW, Chinese can feed a family for $1000/mo total monthly bills. An ENTIRE family for $1000 plus free health care. So, you can't compare rates from China versus rates from the US. You need to be able to feed your family here in the US. Don't become a slave to the system."
"You are not an idiot - you are born of the stars. And so you must always be in oneness with your lovelies from your best, highest self. That means not putting yourself down, but approaching this from the perspective that either someone else really needed this more and the spirit of the stone knew that (and one could argue in conjunction with your higher self which knew exactly the shirts to wear to make it all happen), or 2) It felt you had gotten everything you could from it and so made a gentle exit or 3) It will make its way back to you in some fashion. 

I would also light a candle and meditate on it for a bit until you have a clear picture of it in your mind and you can feel the heart connection and then send a little prayer of gratitude to it for being with you, and telling it how much you love it and hiw special it is and how you do so want to see it again. 

Stones break and they leave. And they do sometimes come back. Blessed be the Spirit of the Stone."

"Just the other day, I put a pearl necklace on my orange tabby and asked him if he was a pearl boy. Within seconds he had maneuvered the necklace around his torso. I chased him around four different rooms trying to help him get it off and finally caught him when he was distracted as he was chewing and pulling on my brand new $4 estate sale REAL pearl necklace (score). That necklace was on its last life, mere moments from being snapped and pearls strewn about my living room which was also scary because he likes to grab tiny rolling objects and run away with them in his little mouth (AirPods, rings, beads) so I also saved him from choking. It was an intense 30 seconds but lessons were learned.

If it was in front of me right now I definitely would give $20 to have that!!! (CAD) It looks beautiful I love amethyst
You can use Google to find out like there's an üëÅ thingy look in your photos pull the picture up and look in the upper right hand corner.
Crystal shops tend to overprice a lot of the things they sell! I personally think if you really love it then it‚Äôs worth it though . But in my opinion I wouldn‚Äôt pay more than $10-$15 for that necklace. It‚Äôs pretty but it‚Äôs not a super unique kind of crystal and they are all so small.
Good idea about videos!!  Thank you!

No. I could make that myself for like $2.

Very cool! Did you dig that piece or order it? I've done both... lol. I've got some Scolcite that I would never be able to find in the USA. Found at a local trade show.

Unfortunate but you never know how much someone else might have needed a little light in their life.

If it is hand made and with real stone it worth probably more than $25 depending on the type of stone. If it is a cheap chinese plastic crap I wll give away and I will not pay a single dollar.

"Smoky quartz point, very cool"
Rainbow fluorite. Beautiful
Looks like Smokey quartz to me!
"Yes, the lighter color could be impurities/ inclusions in the jade. Like chalcedony or chrysotile. Looks to be from India region."
"Is it worth $20?
-depends on what the clasps and chain are made of. If they're good quality, then yes.

Why?
-Because you can easily go to Hobby Lobby or Michaels or something and get some little amethyst gems and make your own necklace for less than that. But an experienced and/or creative jewelry maker who cares about their products might put some effort into it, and you could tell by the quality they put into it. 

For example, you can find Ammonite necklaces for $20-$30 but literally I just went to Hobby Lobby and bought an ammonite pendant for $7 and some waxed cotton chord for another $5 or so and that's good enough for me,"
"This might be an unpopular opinion to me, but $20 is cheap. Paying only $10 would just cover the cost of materials if you bought the materials locally. It probably took 30-60 minutes to assemble, so you are ""valuing"" your time. What's your time worth? $10/hr? Let's not forget the fees you pay when taking payment or hosting a stand at a local market. Anyone who's ever ran a business knows the value of your product. Consumers have been spoiled by Temu and Shein. You can't get those prices in the US, that's why they buy overseas. Duh, then expect Americans to charge Chinese prices. Insane. Nope. Don't cave to their unrealistic expectations. Charge $30 or two for $50. Then matching bracelet for $5. Your time is worth something. And BTW, Chinese can feed a family for $1000/mo total monthly bills. An ENTIRE family for $1000 plus free health care. So, you can't compare rates from China versus rates from the US. You need to be able to feed your family here in the US. Don't become a slave to the system."
"You are not an idiot - you are born of the stars. And so you must always be in oneness with your lovelies from your best, highest self. That means not putting yourself down, but approaching this from the perspective that either someone else really needed this more and the spirit of the stone knew that (and one could argue in conjunction with your higher self which knew exactly the shirts to wear to make it all happen), or 2) It felt you had gotten everything you could from it and so made a gentle exit or 3) It will make its way back to you in some fashion. 

I would also light a candle and meditate on it for a bit until you have a clear picture of it in your mind and you can feel the heart connection and then send a little prayer of gratitude to it for being with you, and telling it how much you love it and hiw special it is and how you do so want to see it again. 

Stones break and they leave. And they do sometimes come back. Blessed be the Spirit of the Stone."

"Before you completely give up on your lost crystal, try seeing if anyone has turned it in at your job (most places have lost and found areas).

"Just the other day, I put a pearl necklace on my orange tabby and asked him if he was a pearl boy. Within seconds he had maneuvered the necklace around his torso. I chased him around four different rooms trying to help him get it off and finally caught him when he was distracted as he was chewing and pulling on my brand new $4 estate sale REAL pearl necklace (score). That necklace was on its last life, mere moments from being snapped and pearls strewn about my living room which was also scary because he likes to grab tiny rolling objects and run away with them in his little mouth (AirPods, rings, beads) so I also saved him from choking. It was an intense 30 seconds but lessons were learned.

If it was in front of me right now I definitely would give $20 to have that!!! (CAD) It looks beautiful I love amethyst
You can use Google to find out like there's an üëÅ thingy look in your photos pull the picture up and look in the upper right hand corner.
Crystal shops tend to overprice a lot of the things they sell! I personally think if you really love it then it‚Äôs worth it though . But in my opinion I wouldn‚Äôt pay more than $10-$15 for that necklace. It‚Äôs pretty but it‚Äôs not a super unique kind of crystal and they are all so small.
Good idea about videos!!  Thank you!
"That‚Äôs what I tell myself when I lose things, it does take away the sting a bit!"
Most definitely unakite..
No. I could make that myself for like $2.
"It was at some type of convention or warehouse sale, there were many vendors. It was so cool!"
But be aware: They often are pricey.
Look for Zuni fetishes in Google.
Very cool! Did you dig that piece or order it? I've done both... lol. I've got some Scolcite that I would never be able to find in the USA. Found at a local trade show.
"I hope I find the jade coffin, sounds amazing!"
"Nice bunch! I carry a medicine bag, as well, and in it I carry a bear fetish in turquoise, two crystals, and a small swath of hair (my granddaughter‚Äôs)."
"Gorgeous!  I have one too!

Unfortunate but you never know how much someone else might have needed a little light in their life. I actually carry them all the time & occasionally I'll give them as gifts to random strangers I think need them. I have always had people really grateful & happy to get them. Maybe someone needed it more than you today. The Universe works in strange but magical ways like that. üí´üíõüí´
Unikite
If it is hand made and with real stone it worth probably more than $25 depending on the type of stone. If it is a cheap chinese plastic crap I wll give away and I will not pay a single dollar.
Sounds like you like pretty specimens like me.
Yes i would pay 20. Ive paid 10 for amethyst bracelets

"I live in the US and I would pay $20 for it if it's labeled as handmade, small business, etc. I used to run a small business and I have made jewelry so I know what goes into the time of planning, purchasing, putting it all together and then the time to post it. I only closed my small business because I had to take care of a couple extra family members and I didn't have the time and energy for both.

I have used formulas to price my art and creations (materials + labor + overhead + profit = final price) or Multiply your material cost by a predetermined factor (like 2.5 or 3) to arrive at a selling price.

"Smoky quartz point, very cool"
Rainbow fluorite. Beautiful
Looks like Smokey quartz to me!
"Yes, the lighter color could be impurities/ inclusions in the jade. Like chalcedony or chrysotile. Looks to be from India region."
"Is it worth $20?
-depends on what the clasps and chain are made of. If they're good quality, then yes.

Why?
-Because you can easily go to Hobby Lobby or Michaels or something and get some little amethyst gems and make your own necklace for less than that. But an experienced and/or creative jewelry maker who cares about their products might put some effort into it, and you could tell by the quality they put into it. 

For example, you can find Ammonite necklaces for $20-$30 but literally I just went to Hobby Lobby and bought an ammonite pendant for $7 and some waxed cotton chord for another $5 or so and that's good enough for me,"
"This might be an unpopular opinion to me, but $20 is cheap. Paying only $10 would just cover the cost of materials if you bought the materials locally. It probably took 30-60 minutes to assemble, so you are ""valuing"" your time. What's your time worth? $10/hr? Let's not forget the fees you pay when taking payment or hosting a stand at a local market. Anyone who's ever ran a business knows the value of your product. Consumers have been spoiled by Temu and Shein. You can't get those prices in the US, that's why they buy overseas. Duh, then expect Americans to charge Chinese prices. Insane. Nope. Don't cave to their unrealistic expectations. Charge $30 or two for $50. Then matching bracelet for $5. Your time is worth something. And BTW, Chinese can feed a family for $1000/mo total monthly bills. An ENTIRE family for $1000 plus free health care. So, you can't compare rates from China versus rates from the US. You need to be able to feed your family here in the US. Don't become a slave to the system."
"You are not an idiot - you are born of the stars. And so you must always be in oneness with your lovelies from your best, highest self. That means not putting yourself down, but approaching this from the perspective that either someone else really needed this more and the spirit of the stone knew that (and one could argue in conjunction with your higher self which knew exactly the shirts to wear to make it all happen), or 2) It felt you had gotten everything you could from it and so made a gentle exit or 3) It will make its way back to you in some fashion. 

I would also light a candle and meditate on it for a bit until you have a clear picture of it in your mind and you can feel the heart connection and then send a little prayer of gratitude to it for being with you, and telling it how much you love it and hiw special it is and how you do so want to see it again. 

Stones break and they leave. And they do sometimes come back. Blessed be the Spirit of the Stone."

"Before you completely give up on your lost crystal, try seeing if anyone has turned it in at your job (most places have lost and found areas). You could also try asking coworkers if they've seen it... let them know it was very sentimental to you. Hopefully, someone will do the right thing and return it to you. In the future, if you're going to carry around loose crystals, I would only do so in a draw string pouch attached to a necklace (preferably)."

Crystal shops tend to overprice a lot of the things they sell! I personally think if you really love it then it‚Äôs worth it though . But in my opinion I wouldn‚Äôt pay more than $10-$15 for that necklace. It‚Äôs pretty but it‚Äôs not a super unique kind of crystal and they are all so small.
Good idea about videos!!  Thank you!
"That‚Äôs what I tell myself when I lose things, it does take away the sting a bit!"
Most definitely unakite..
No. I could make that myself for like $2.
"It was at some type of convention or warehouse sale, there were many vendors. It was so cool!"
But be aware: They often are pricey.
Look for Zuni fetishes in Google.
Very cool! Did you dig that piece or order it? I've done both... lol. I've got some Scolcite that I would never be able to find in the USA. Found at a local trade show.
"I hope I find the jade coffin, sounds amazing!"
"Nice bunch! I carry a medicine bag, as well, and in it I carry a bear fetish in turquoise, two crystals, and a small swath of hair (my granddaughter‚Äôs)."
"Gorgeous!  I have one too!

Unfortunate but you never know how much someone else might have needed a little light in their life. I actually carry them all the time & occasionally I'll give them as gifts to random strangers I think need them. I have always had people really grateful & happy to get them. Maybe someone needed it more than you today. The Universe works in strange but magical ways like that. üí´üíõüí´

If it is hand made and with real stone it worth probably more than $25 depending on the type of stone. If it is a cheap chinese plastic crap I wll give away and I will not pay a single dollar.

"Smoky quartz point, very cool"
Rainbow fluorite. Beautiful
Looks like Smokey quartz to me!
"Yes, the lighter color could be impurities/ inclusions in the jade. Like chalcedony or chrysotile. Looks to be from India region."
"Is it worth $20?
-depends on what the clasps and chain are made of. If they're good quality, then yes.

Why?
-Because you can easily go to Hobby Lobby or Michaels or something and get some little amethyst gems and make your own necklace for less than that. But an experienced and/or creative jewelry maker who cares about their products might put some effort into it, and you could tell by the quality they put into it. 

For example, you can find Ammonite necklaces for $20-$30 but literally I just went to Hobby Lobby and bought an ammonite pendant for $7 and some waxed cotton chord for another $5 or so and that's good enough for me,"
"This might be an unpopular opinion to me, but $20 is cheap. Paying only $10 would just cover the cost of materials if you bought the materials locally. It probably took 30-60 minutes to assemble, so you are ""valuing"" your time. What's your time worth? $10/hr? Let's not forget the fees you pay when taking payment or hosting a stand at a local market. Anyone who's ever ran a business knows the value of your product. Consumers have been spoiled by Temu and Shein. You can't get those prices in the US, that's why they buy overseas. Duh, then expect Americans to charge Chinese prices. Insane. Nope. Don't cave to their unrealistic expectations. Charge $30 or two for $50. Then matching bracelet for $5. Your time is worth something. And BTW, Chinese can feed a family for $1000/mo total monthly bills. An ENTIRE family for $1000 plus free health care. So, you can't compare rates from China versus rates from the US. You need to be able to feed your family here in the US. Don't become a slave to the system."
"You are not an idiot - you are born of the stars. And so you must always be in oneness with your lovelies from your best, highest self. That means not putting yourself down, but approaching this from the perspective that either someone else really needed this more and the spirit of the stone knew that (and one could argue in conjunction with your higher self which knew exactly the shirts to wear to make it all happen), or 2) It felt you had gotten everything you could from it and so made a gentle exit or 3) It will make its way back to you in some fashion. 

I would also light a candle and meditate on it for a bit until you have a clear picture of it in your mind and you can feel the heart connection and then send a little prayer of gratitude to it for being with you, and telling it how much you love it and hiw special it is and how you do so want to see it again. 

Stones break and they leave. And they do sometimes come back. Blessed be the Spirit of the Stone."

"Before you completely give up on your lost crystal, try seeing if anyone has turned it in at your job (most places have lost and found areas). You could also try asking coworkers if they've seen it... let them know it was very sentimental to you. Hopefully, someone will do the right thing and return it to you. In the future, if you're going to carry around loose crystals, I would only do so in a draw string pouch attached to a necklace (preferably)."

"Nice bunch! I carry a medicine bag, as well, and in it I carry a bear fetish in turquoise, two crystals, and a small swath of hair (my granddaughter‚Äôs)."
"Gorgeous!  I have one too!

Thanks!!
Unfortunate but you never know how much someone else might have needed a little light in their life. I actually carry them all the time & occasionally I'll give them as gifts to random strangers I think need them. I have always had people really grateful & happy to get them. Maybe someone needed it more than you today. The Universe works in strange but magical ways like that. üí´üíõüí´
Unikite
If it is hand made and with real stone it worth probably more than $25 depending on the type of stone. If it is a cheap chinese plastic crap I wll give away and I will not pay a single dollar.
Sounds like you like pretty specimens like me.
Yes i would pay 20. Ive paid 10 for amethyst bracelets
The leaf slab design is such a good idea for a moss agate omggg üò©
"I have a very yellow smokey quartz with insane clarity, so it could be smokey quartz? It's not often I see natural citrine (personally)"
Thank you! The orange/red areas are usually darker on Unakite so I wasn't 100% sure.
Where did you get it / how much did it cost? üëÄ
It sure is
Are all of these lab grown?
I have a feeling it‚Äôs going to find its way back to you!
I believe this may be Unakite
üòç
"*possibly*
Top row: clear quartz, rose quartz, blue vein jade
Bottom row: white jade, white jade, yooperlite (uv reactive)"
"I live in the US and I would pay $20 for it if it's labeled as handmade, small business, etc. I used to run a small business and I have made jewelry so I know what goes into the time of planning, purchasing, putting it all together and then the time to post it. I only closed my small business because I had to take care of a couple extra family members and I didn't have the time and energy for both.

I have used formulas to price my art and creations (materials + labor + overhead + profit = final price) or Multiply your material cost by a predetermined factor (like 2.5 or 3) to arrive at a selling price. I have a similar formula that I was using for my small business but I can't find it at the moment. I found these on Google though and they are similar to what I was doing. Here is a screenshot of what I found on Google. I hope it helps.

Best of luck! I hope you see more of your pieces."
What‚Äôs the first one?
"Hard to tell but this is my jade owl that has similar marbling. It was identified by seller as Canadian mined jade

"Flash pretty muted considering you're outside in full sun.   Probably cost as much to return it if the destination is in another country.  It's not horrible so I'd keep it, but I don't do Temu, Wish, etc."
"I wish people would quit doing this to us! Idc if I get downvoted but this is clearly dyed or enhanced & half the stuff I see now (esp Etsy) is not what it says it is! I feel bad for OP and all of us due to the wasted hours that we‚Äôve all spent zooming, wondering, asking. I just wish people would leave them in their natural beautiful state. Btw: this is really pretty! Please excuse my mini rant. Im hungry ü§≠"
That color is absolutely incredible!! Thanks for sharing!
No
I have had crystals disappear off shelves while living alone. I always take it as they did their job with me and now have to find someone new to help.
Nice !
It looks well made also
"Seems about right , 20 dollars is nothing anymore."
"Alternately, bring them with you but ensure they are being carried safely so that they won't get lost! üòÖ

I usually keep mine inside a little pouch, and then inside my bag or pocket. Seems to work out well! Haven't lost anyone yet ü•∞ü§™"
Smoky quartz
"Ask the Universe to replace your lost stone with another crystal, be it the same type or different... let it know you want a crystal that is going to vibe with you and help you on your current path.

The last time I put it out there that I felt I needed some crystals I don't yet have, less than 2 weeks later, I found a deal of a lifetime for a dozen or so crystals. Many of which I have wanted for a long time. I felt drawn as hell to them, and the lady selling them was an angel, and I don't know how she parted with them for so cheap, but yeah. Paid something like less than $10 for each. When I got them in the mail, I knew for certain that the Universe had answered my call. üíú"
I had an awesome mahogany obsidian stone I lost about 2 weeks ago. I hope a new owner found it and it's energies are helping them! At least I still have my petrified wood ‚ô•
"Smoky quartz point, very cool"
Rainbow fluorite. Beautiful
Looks like Smokey quartz to me!
"Yes, the lighter color could be impurities/ inclusions in the jade. Like chalcedony or chrysotile. Looks to be from India region."
"Is it worth $20?
-depends on what the clasps and chain are made of. If they're good quality, then yes.

Why?
-Because you can easily go to Hobby Lobby or Michaels or something and get some little amethyst gems and make your own necklace for less than that. But an experienced and/or creative jewelry maker who cares about their products might put some effort into it, and you could tell by the quality they put into it. 

For example, you can find Ammonite necklaces for $20-$30 but literally I just went to Hobby Lobby and bought an ammonite pendant for $7 and some waxed cotton chord for another $5 or so and that's good enough for me,"
"This might be an unpopular opinion to me, but $20 is cheap. Paying only $10 would just cover the cost of materials if you bought the materials locally. It probably took 30-60 minutes to assemble, so you are ""valuing"" your time. What's your time worth? $10/hr? Let's not forget the fees you pay when taking payment or hosting a stand at a local market. Anyone who's ever ran a business knows the value of your product. Consumers have been spoiled by Temu and Shein. You can't get those prices in the US, that's why they buy overseas. Duh, then expect Americans to charge Chinese prices. Insane. Nope. Don't cave to their unrealistic expectations. Charge $30 or two for $50. Then matching bracelet for $5. Your time is worth something. And BTW, Chinese can feed a family for $1000/mo total monthly bills. An ENTIRE family for $1000 plus free health care. So, you can't compare rates from China versus rates from the US. You need to be able to feed your family here in the US. Don't become a slave to the system."
"You are not an idiot - you are born of the stars. And so you must always be in oneness with your lovelies from your best, highest self. That means not putting yourself down, but approaching this from the perspective that either someone else really needed this more and the spirit of the stone knew that (and one could argue in conjunction with your higher self which knew exactly the shirts to wear to make it all happen), or 2) It felt you had gotten everything you could from it and so made a gentle exit or 3) It will make its way back to you in some fashion. 

I would also light a candle and meditate on it for a bit until you have a clear picture of it in your mind and you can feel the heart connection and then send a little prayer of gratitude to it for being with you, and telling it how much you love it and hiw special it is and how you do so want to see it again. 

Stones break and they leave. And they do sometimes come back. Blessed be the Spirit of the Stone."
"$15, and that‚Äôs only if I made it by hand and was going to sell it if a craft fair"
‚ÄúThanks. Smuggled it out of Africa in my arse‚Äù
Looks like a cookies and cream treat
Calcite is quite soft at a hardness of 3 and this stone has a hardness of 7
correct
it doesn‚Äôt have the lemony yellow tone of any lemon quartz that i‚Äôve seen
Men are not bright.
"Before you completely give up on your lost crystal, try seeing if anyone has turned it in at your job (most places have lost and found areas). You could also try asking coworkers if they've seen it... let them know it was very sentimental to you. Hopefully, someone will do the right thing and return it to you. In the future, if you're going to carry around loose crystals, I would only do so in a draw string pouch attached to a necklace (preferably)."
I would say rhodonite.   Looks like the color may be enhanced.
"Lab, Amazonite, Carnelian and can‚Äôt make out the other 3‚Ä¶. Need better pictures"
Fluorite
Agreed!
"Little steep at $20, but if it sings to you..."
Looks like Lower Grade Rhodochrosite
Druzy Agate!
Looks like Sodalite (seller here)
Aura Quartz
Rhodochrosite possibly but I doubt it lacks the white. People tend to confuse these stones. It is Rhodonite though (Seller)
"Is it actually a loop at the bottom? I thought it was just the necklace touching the sides together. But now I look at it, it does look like a loop‚Ä¶"
No way
"If it was sold by a local shop that ethically sources their crystals, definitely."
I‚Äôm leaning towards smoky quartz
I was really thinking there was something phallic about it
all rhodonite has pink in it! But yes its rhodonite
Ofc!
Ofc
I love labradorite and never seen this kind of flash in person. I‚Äôm happy with my purchase üåª
I'm gonna go with lemon quartz.
Agate bookends....lovely find!  I found my favorite amethyst at HomeGoods ;)
WOW!! If carnelian and ocean jasper snuck off and had a love rock‚Ä¶.
"Village Silversmith rocks account sells lab palms like these between $4 and $8. Smaller, reputable sellers will run $10-12."
15$
"I have a cool phantom lab grown quartz like this! They are cool looking for sure. Definitely lab grown, but perfect pieces for planters in my house!"
"No, but that's only because I make necklaces and could do this myself. No disrespect at all, but this is simple stringing beadwork. Also, I am always very aware of things touching my skin, and these irregular chip beads distract me."
"A couple weeks ago I started sleeping with raw Celestite next to my pillow on my side table. I have been sleeping so good and dreaming vividly. I didn‚Äôt know this about Celestite before getting my  piece, but it‚Äôs supposed to be one of the best crystals for sleep. I can attest it has been highly noticeable since I got mine. Gorgeous piece you have!"
"I'm sorry for your loss.   Be careful.  There may be fiberglass or sharp crystals.

Edit:  It looks like glued crystals (possibly lab grown) with spiky, sharp lab grown crystals covering the glued areas.   Here's one without the extra added crystals.

This is the cutest!
"I‚Äôm in the US Midwest in a college town. For a necklace that length, at a local shop, it would go for $30. So I‚Äôd gladly pay $20."
Ohhh that is perfect!
"My first amethyst, i found a chipped heart in a parking lot. I love it so much, and I give thanks to the person who lost it, whoever they may be."
"My friend made me a gem and wire pendant and like to carry it with me instead of wearing it I found a small drawstring bag amongst my things from a crystal purchase and now i carry the pendant around w a couple of other tiny stones. 

So I still go to check all day to, make sure it's still in my pocket, but it's working for now- one time I lost the pendanit for a few days in the house and boy, i was devastated. 

You're not an idiot for this happening, not at all.  It's just a lesson learned about pokey pieces in you pocket.

It's okay to be really upset. But you'll find another, new piece to cherish."
Calcite???
that‚Äôs a happy accident! someone else can enjoy it now
That‚Äôs a hard no for me.
